Vi is the de facto standard editor in UNIX systems.  It comes with two modes:

  - ${H2}Command mode (default):${H0} administrative tasks such as saving files,
    executing commands, moving the cursor, cutting and pasting lines or words,
    as well as finding and replacing.  ${UL}Return to command mode with Esc${H0}

  - ${H2}Insert mode:${H0} Everything that's typed in this mode is interpreted as
    input and placed in the file.

${H2}Navigation commands${H0}

  h - move the cursor one character to the left
  j - move the cursor down one character
  k - mode the cursor up one character
  l - move the cursor right one character
  b - move to beginning of word, or previous word
  w - move to next word
  0 - move to beginning of line
  $ - move to end of line
 :0 - move to beginning of file
  G - move to end of file

${H2}Editing commands${H0}

  u - undo last operation
  x - delete the character the cursor is on
 cw - change word, from position of cursor
 dw - delete to end of word
 dd - delete the line the character is on
  p - paste (line, word, or char) after cursor
  P - paste (line, word, or char) before cursor

Mg is a bit more user-friendly than vi.  It has the same familiar interface
as Notepad, but with slightly different keybindings.

${H2}Introduction${H0}

Most commands involve using the Control ("Ctrl") or the Meta ("Alt") key.
The following conventions are used in the online help:

  C-<chr>   means hold down the Control key while typing the character <chr>
  M-<chr>   means hold down the Alt key while typing the character <chr>

If you don't have a Meta/Alt key, you can use Esc instead.  Press and release
the Esc key and then type <chr>. This is equivalent to M-<chr>.

${H2}Navigation${H0}

Though arrow keys, Home/End, and PgUp/PgDn usually work, using Mg over serial
console can sometimes cause these keys to be mismapped by terminal program.

  C-f          Move forward one character (can also use right arrow key)
  C-b          Move backward one character (can also use left arrow key)
  C-p          Move up one line (can also use up arrow key)
  C-n          Move down one line (can also use down arrow key)
  M-f          Move forward one word
  M-b          Move backward one word
  C-a          Move to beginning of line (can also use Home key)
  C-e          Move to end of line (can also use End key)
  C-v          Move forward one page (can also use PgDn/Page Down key)
  M-v          Move backward one page (can also use PgUp/Page Up key)
  M-<          Move to beginning of file
  M->          Move to end of file
  C-x g        Move to line number

This section details how to set up everything from basic to advanced networking.
Topics covered include:

 - Static vs Dynamic Addresses
 - VLAN Interfaces
 - Bridging Interfaces
 - Link Aggregation (bonding)
 - Persistent Configuration

Please note, the terms 'port' and 'interface' may be used interchangably in
the following text (and elsewher online as well).  Usually the term 'port' is
reserved for Ethernet links attached to a switch or bridge, while the term
'interface' more generically refers to the physical interface in a system.


${H2}Static vs Dynamic Addresses${H0}

An IPv4 address consists of four "octets" separated by periods.  A static IPv4
address can look like this:

    192.168.1.42

However, for networking to function properly, a device usually needs a netmask,
default route, NTP server, and at least one DNS address.  Setting all these up
statically is a lot of work to maintain, in particular with many devices.

For both IPv4 and IPv6 there is an alternative called DHCP.  It is a dynamic
protocol where a server on request from a client device hands out a "lease" of
an IP address, as well as lot of other network parameters, including but not
limited to the ones already mentioned.  A client device can give hints to the
server, e.g., its hostname, MAC address (default), or other client identifier.
It is up to the server to honor these hints or not, but it is very common to
set up the server to honor the client's hostname and automatically update the
central name server (DNS) when the client is online.

        |  There are many other interesting aspects to DHCP not covered here.
        |  For instance, DHCP relay servers (proxies), that can be used to
        |  forward DHCP requests from very large networks to a central server.
        |  Some relay "agents" even support something called Option 82, which
        |  when running on a simple switch, can attach port and relay info to
        |  the client's DHCP request -- allowing the server to assign an IP
        |  address per port, even on remote switches (with a relay agent).

When your interface is setup with DHCP, use the 'ifconfig' or 'ip addr' tools
to see which address you got, if needed (see next section).

In cases when the DHCP client cannot find a DHCP server, and thus not obtain a
lesae, the system falls back to set a link-local address (169.254.*.*).  This
can be disabled by editing the file /etc/dhcpcd.conf, adding:

    noipv4ll

A link-local address is however very useful, in particular in combination with
mDNS to discover and access a device you do not know, or do not want to know,
the IP address to.  See more in the next section.


${H2}DNS and mDNS${H0}

Managing a central DNS is both painful and time consuming, most networks, and
in particular industrial, therefore only set up a DNS for static servers and
resources.  Leaving end devices, switches, and in many cases even routers,
without a human-friendly name on the network.  This have misled many to think
that they need to know the IP address, and often opt for static addresses on
equipment.  Meaning many devices out-of-the-box have a static address set that
need to be manually changed before the device is deployed on the network.

A less time consuming, and human-friendly, way is to enable mDNS (multicast
DNS).  With this protocol the device notifies all neighbors on the same LAN
of how to reach it:

    "Hello everyone, my address is 169.254.47.11, you can call me device.local"

Any other device that also has mDNS enabled can then automaticall update a
local database of name-to-address mappings.  Usually the name sent out is
the device's hostname.  (It is up to the device manufacturer to set a useful
default hostname, i.e., model-01-02-03, where the suffix is the last octets
of the base MAC address, from the product label on the case.)

As you can see, in combination with a link-local address (previous section)
mDNS is a very attractive combination that greatly simplify device management.

Tools:

    avahi-browse -a
    ping foo.local

mDNS, or more correctly mDNS-SD, is also used for *Service Discovery*.  E.g.,
a printer can publish IPP records with meta data on the printer type and model
or donwload URL for drivers.  Switches and routers usually publish how they
can be reached: HTTP/HTTPS and SSH.

Note: there are other mechanisms for device discovery.  Microsoft have been
      slow to adopt mDNS, having relied on their own SSDP protocol.  For the
      full experince Apple's "Bonjour" can be installed in Windows.

      mDNS is supported in this product and should be enabled by default.  To
      verify it works, open the Windows File Explorer (Win+E) and scroll to
      Network in the left-hand menu.  An icon with a matching hostname can be
      found there which, when clicked, opens up the device's Web Interface.
      macOS users have mDNS fully integrated by default.  Linux users can use
      'mdns-scan' or Avahi, as shown above.  The latter two can also just set
      their web browsers to https://hostname-01-02-03.local


${H2}VLAN Interfaces${H0}

A VLAN interface in Linux is an "upper" interface, e.g., 'eth0.1'.  It is
where you set an IP address and interact with th rest of the world.  The
base/raw/lower interface, here 'eth0', is the physical interface on which
Ethernet packets ingress and egress with a VLAN tag.  To create 'eth0.1':

    ip link add eth0.1 link eth0 vlan id 1

In Linux a VLAN interface is a "stackable" entity.  Many VLAN interfaces
can be built on top of each other.  When injecting a packet on the top
most interface, the kernel adds the corresponding VLAN "tag" when the
packet goes down the order of stacked interfaces, and then finally hits
the physical interface and proceeds to egress onto the media.

    ip link add eth0.1.2 link eth0.1 vlan id 2

Injecting a packet on 'eth0.1.2' creates a double-tagged VLAN frame when
the packet egresses 'eth0'.  The outermost tag has VID 1 and the inner
VID is 2.

VLAN interfaces can be used for many things, here we will focus on their
use as upper interface on a bridge.


${H2}Bridging Interfaces${H0}

A bridge is the correct name for a switch.  In the context of this text,
however, we will use the term to refer to the Linux bridge module in the
kernel, which implements an advanced software switch.  The Linux bridge
supports "offloading" many switching functions to an underlying switching
chipset, when available.  This greatly simplifies managing that switch since
the same tools one use to manage the bridge will, by extension, also be used
to manage the switch.

To create a bridge in Linux:

    ip link add br0 type bridge

To add three ports (interfaces) to the bridge we use:

    ip link set eth0 master br0
    ip link set eth1 master br0
    ip link set eth2 master br0

Bring all ports and the bridge 'up' and you have a working switch!  Any frame
injected on eth0 (from the outside) can be switched to either of eth1, eth2,
*or* br0.  As soon as the bridge has learned where end devices are connected,
none of the other ports will see the traffic -- like a regular switch.

Note: these ports should not (cannot) have any IP address.  Instead, any IP
      address is set on 'br0'.  To disable IPv6 link-local address, set the
      /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/disable_ipv6 sysctl file to '1'.


${H2}Bridging and VLANs${H0}

A VLAN-aware bridge works the same way, only with VLAN separation taken into
account.  All communication, as well as MAC address learning, is limited to
ports in the same VLAN.  The syntax is slightly different and requires a few
more steps:

    ip link add br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1
    ip link set eth0 master br0
    ip link set eth1 master br0
    ip link set eth2 master br0
    ip link set eth3 master br0

To assign ports to different VLANs, and make sure they are regular "access"
ports (untagged).  We assign eth0 and eth1 to VLAN 1 and the others to VLAN 2:

    bridge vlan add vid 1 dev eth0 pvid untagged
    bridge vlan add vid 1 dev eth1 pvid untagged
    bridge vlan add vid 2 dev eth2 pvid untagged
    bridge vlan add vid 2 dev eth3 pvid untagged

Here's the twist, to be able to reach the bridge (switch) itself from each
VLAN, we need to ensure the bridge itself is a tagged member of each VLAN:

    bridge vlan add vid 1 dev br0 self
    bridge vlan add vid 2 dev br0 self

This way we can add VLAN interfaces on top of br0, which we in turn can set
a static or dynamic IP address on:

    ip link add vlan1 link br0 type vlan id 1
    ip link add vlan2 link br0 type vlan id 2

The resulting stack of interfaces look like this:

                         :
                vlan1    :     vlan2       Layer-3 :: IP Networking
                    \\    :    /            _________________________
                  .-------------.
                  |     br0     |          Layer-2 :: Switching
                  '-------------'          _________________________
                  /   |  :  |   \\
              eth0 eth1  :  eth2 eth3      Layer-1 :: Link layer
                         :


${H2}Persistent Configuration${H0}

A simple end device can get by with the following in /etc/network/interfaces:

    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp

This brings up both the loopback (required for UNIX networking to function),
and the (presumed only) Ethernet interface.  The loopback gets its standard
address, 127.0.0.1, and eth0 will request its IP address using DHCP.

To set up the bridge example (above), is actually quite a lot easier than
using the command line ip and bridge tools.  Create the file 'bridge':

    edit /etc/network/interfaces.d/bridge

Paste in the following content:

    iface e0
        bridge-access 1
    iface e1
        bridge-access 1
    iface e2
        bridge-access 2
    iface e3
        bridge-access 2

    auto br0
    iface br0
        bridge-ports e0 e1 e2 e3 
        bridge-vlan-aware yes
        bridge-stp on
        bridge-vids 1 2

    auto vlan1
    iface vlan1 inet dhcp
        vlan-id 1
        vlan-raw-device br0

    auto vlan2
    iface vlan2 inet static
        vlan-id 2
        vlan-raw-device br0
        address 192.168.2.1/24

Notice how 'vlan1' only has a DHCP and 'vlan2' uses a static address.  It is
possible to combine the two if needed.  Use 'inet dhcp' and add an 'address'
statement to the iface stanza.


${H2}Port Classification${H0}

The bundled 'show' script is a very handy tool.  It use several tricks to make
information about the system more accessible.  On switching capable hardware
products, switch ports are identified early at system bootstrap and placed in
the 'port' group.  See 'ip link' output:

    ...
    4: e0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> master br0 state UP ${UL}group port${H0}
           link/ether 52:54:00:12:34:56 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    ...

When running in Qemu or other hardware it may be useful to manually classify
certain interfaces as ports.  This can be achieved in many ways, here we show
two.  First /etc/mactab, which is read at boot to rename interfaces according
their matching MAC address, one interface per line:

    e0    52:54:00:12:34:56
    e1    52:54:00:12:34:57
    e2    52:54:00:12:34:58
    e3    52:54:00:12:34:59

Another way is to add something like this to /etc/rc.local:

    for port in eth0 eth1 eth3 eth4; do
        ip link set \$port group port

 - /etc/dhcpcd.conf             General DHCP and ZeroConf (LL) settings
 - /etc/network/interfaces      The original, useful for small setups
 - /etc/network/interfaces.d/*  Snippets, useful for non-trivial setups
 - /etc/mactab                  Rename interfaces: 'NAME16CHARS WHITESPACE MAC'
 - /etc/sysctl.conf             Interface and TCP/IP settings, e.g., routing

${H1}Summary                                                                        ${H0}

All persistent networking is set up in /etc/network/interfaces using the
program ifupdown-ng.  The tools to reconfigure networking at runtime are:

   ifup   [-a] [IFACES]
   ifdown [-a] [IFACES]

When changing the configuration at runtime you usually have to bring the
affected interfaces down (ifdown e0 e1 e2 e3), if they were set up with
/etc/network/interfaces before.  Then do the change, and bring it all up
again.

Both tools understand dependencies between interfaces, so when a 'ifup -a'
command is received it brings up all interfaces: adding links to br0 before
adding VLANs, the vlan1 and vlan2 interfaces on top so it of it all.  Then
finally it can start the DHCP client on vlan1 and set the static IP address
on vlan2.
