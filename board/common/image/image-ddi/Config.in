	  Create a Discoverable Disk Image containing:
	  - SquashFS of the root filesystem
	  - dm-verity hash tree of the root filesystem
	  - DDI compliant JSON signature object of the hash tree

	  Path to the private RSA key, in PKCS#8 format, used to sign
	  the dm-verity hash tree.

config IMAGE_DDI_CERT
	string "signing cert"
	depends on IMAGE_DDI
	default "${BR2_EXTERNAL_INFIX_PATH}/board/common/signing-keys/development/infix.crt"
	help
	  Path to the X509 certificate whose associated public key can
	  validate the authenticity of the generated signature.

	  The SHA256 fingerprint of this certificate is recorded
	  alongside the standard PKCS#7 signature in the JSON object,
	  which can be useful to locate corresponding key on systems
	  that lack full X509 parsing capabilities.
