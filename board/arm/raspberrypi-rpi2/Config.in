	  Support for the 32-bit ARMv7 Raspberry Pi 2B single-board computer
	  (SBC) with BCM2836 quad-core Cortex-A7 processor.

	  This was the only Raspberry Pi model with the BCM2836 and the rare
	  RPi 2B board revision v1.2 actually got an underclocked BCM2837,
	  which is the saem Cortex-A53 as the RPi3, but w/o wifi.
