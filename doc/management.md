# Management

The system utilizes YANG models for keeping configuration and operational
data. These databases can be managed through different interfaces such
as NETCONF, RESTCONF, and CLI via SSH or Console.

## SSH Management

An SSH server (SSHv2) is provided for remote management. It can be
enabled/disabled as shown below.

```
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit ssh
admin@example:/config/ssh/> set enabled
admin@example:/config/ssh/>
```

By default the SSH server accepts connections to port 22 on all its IP
addresses, but this can be adjusted using the `listen` command. To
make the server (only) listen for incoming connections to IP address
_192.168.1.1_ and port _12345_ the following commands can be used.

```
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit ssh
admin@example:/config/ssh/> show
enabled true;
hostkey genkey;
listen ipv4 {
  address 0.0.0.0;
  port 22;
}
listen ipv6 {
  address ::;
  port 22;
}
admin@example:/config/ssh/> no listen ipv6
admin@example:/config/ssh/> edit listen ipv4
admin@example:/config/ssh/listen/ipv4/> set address 192.168.1.1
admin@example:/config/ssh/listen/ipv4/> set port 12345
admin@example:/config/ssh/listen/ipv4/>
```

The default SSH hostkey is generated on first boot and is used in both
SSH and NETCONF (SSH transport). Custom keys can be added to the
configuration in `ietf-keystore`. The only supported hostkey type is
RSA for now, thus the private key must be
`ietf-crypto-types:rsa-private-key-format` and the public key
`ietf-crypto-types:ssh-public-key-format`

### Use your own SSH hostkeys

Hostkeys can be generated with OpenSSL:
```bash
openssl genpkey -quiet -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -outform PEM > mykey
openssl rsa -RSAPublicKey_out < mykey > mykey.pub
```
Store the keys in `ietf-keystore` _without_ the header and footer information
created by OpenSSL.

After the key has been stored in the keystore and given the name
_mykey_ it can be added to SSH configuration:

	admin@example:/> configure
	admin@example:/config/> edit ssh
	admin@example:/config/ssh/> set hostkey mykey

## Console Port

For units with a console port, it is possible for users to login to
shell/CLI with functionality similar to what is provided via SSH.

The type and setup for your console port is product specific. For
instance, it can be a USB-C port connected to the CPU serial port
using a USB-to-serial converter. To connect you would need a USB-C cable
connected to the console port of the device. The serial port is
typically setup to run at 115200 baud, 8N1.


```
Infix -- a Network Operating System v24.11.1 (ttyS0)
example login: admin
Password:
.-------.
|  . .  | Infix -- a Network Operating System
|-. v .-| https://kernelkit.org
'-'---'-'

Run the command 'cli' for interactive OAM

admin@example:~$
```

The `resize` command can be used to update terminal settings to the
size of your terminal window.

```
admin@example:~$ resize
COLUMNS=115;LINES=59;export COLUMNS LINES;
admin@example:~$
```

CLI can be entered from shell in the same way as for SSH.

```
admin@example:~$ cli

See the 'help' command for an introduction to the system

admin@example:/> show interfaces
INTERFACE       PROTOCOL   STATE       DATA
lo              ethernet   UP          00:00:00:00:00:00
                ipv4                   127.0.0.1/8 (static)

e2              ethernet   LOWER-DOWN  00:53:00:06:03:02
...
admin@example:/>
```

## Web, Web-console and RESTCONF

The system provides a set of Web services:

- a rudimentary Web server, currently limited to an information page
- a RESTCONF server with equivalent management capabilities as NETCONF
- a Web console service, where the shell/CLI can be accessed via
  HTTPS, similar to connecting via a console port or SSH

There is also a *Netbrowse* Web service presenting information about
the unit's neighbors, collected via mDNS (see
[Discovery](discovery.md) for more details).

```
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit web
admin@example:/config/web/> help
  enabled                           Enable or disable on all web services.
  console                           Web console interface.
  netbrowse                         mDNS Network Browser.
  restconf                          IETF RESTCONF Server.
admin@example:/config/web/>
```

### Enable/disable Web Service and Server

The Web service can be enabled as shown below.

```
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit web
admin@example:/config/web/> set enabled
admin@example:/config/web/> 
```

Enabling the Web service implies that a Web server is
enabled. Currently this Web server provides generic Infix information,
as well as a link to a Web console. The Web server uses HTTPS; any
HTTP request is redirected to HTTPS.

The _enabled_ setting for the Web service acts as a global
enable/disable setting for the other Web services (Web console,
RESTCONF and Netbrowse).

### Enable/disable Web Console

The Web console service provides a terminal service similar to Console
or SSH. The Web console is secured via HTTPS on port 7861.

The Web console has its own enable/disable setting, but will only be
activated if the Web service is enabled. The example below shows how
to disable the Web console.

```
admin@example:/config/web/> edit console
admin@example:/config/web/console/> no enabled
admin@example:/config/web/console/>
```

### Enable/disable RESTCONF Service

Alternatively, the system can be managed remotely using
RESTCONF. Meaning you can `curl` it instead of using a dedicated
NETCONF client.

The RESTCONF service has its own enable/disable setting, but will
only be activated if the Web service is enabled. The example below
shows how to disable the RESTCONF service.

```
admin@example:/config/web/> edit restconf
admin@example:/config/web/restconf/> no enabled
admin@example:/config/web/restconf/>
```
