Welcome to Infix, your friendly Network Operating System!  On these
pages you can find both user and developer documentation.

> Topics on configuring the system include CLI examples, every setting
> is also possible to perform using NETCONF.  In fact, the Infix test
> system solely relies on NETCONF for configuring network topologies.

The CLI documentation is also available from inside the CLI itself using
the `help` command.
