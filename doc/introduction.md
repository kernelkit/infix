# Introduction

This document provides an introduction of key concepts, details how
the system boots, including failure modes, and provides links to
other documents for further study.

## CLI

The command line interface (CLI, see-ell-i) is the traditional way of
interacting with single network equipment like switches and routers.
Today users have come to expect more advanced graphical GUIs, like a web
interface, to manage a device or NETCONF-based tools that allow for
managing entire fleets of installed equipment.

Nevertheless, when it comes to initial deployment and debugging, it
is very useful to know how to navigate and use the CLI.

> Proceed to the [CLI User Guide](cli/tutorial.md).


## Key Concepts

The two modes in the CLI are the admin-exec and the configure context.

However, when logging in to the system, from the console port or SSH,
you land in a standard UNIX shell, Bash.  This is for advanced users
and remote scripting purposes (production equipment).  To enter the
CLI type:

    admin@example:~$ cli
    admin@example:/>

The prompt, constructed from your username and the device's hostname,
changes slightly.  You are now in the admin-exec context of the CLI.
Here you can inspect system status and do operations to debug networking
issues, e.g. ping.  You can also enter configure context by typing:
`configure` followed by commands to `set`, `edit`, apply changes using
`leave`, or `abort` and return to admin-exec.

The system has several datastores (or files):

 - `factory-config` consists of a set of default configurations, some
   static and others generated per-device, e.g., a unique hostname and
   number of ports/interfaces.   This file is generated at boot, if it
   does not exist, i.e., only on first boot or after factory reset.
 - `failure-config` is also generated at boot, from the same YANG models
   as `factory-config`, and holds the system *Fail Secure Mode*
 - `startup-config` is created from `factory-config` at boot if it does
   not exist.  It is loaded as the system configuration on each boot.
 - `running-config` is what is actively running on the system.  If no
   changes have been made since the system booted, it is the same as
   `startup-config`.
 - `candidate-config` is created from `running-config` when entering the
   configure context.  Any changes made here can be discarded (`abort`,
   `rollback`) or committed (`commit`, `leave`) to `running-config`.

## System Boot

After the system firmware (BIOS or and [boot loader](boot.md) start
Linux the following happens.  The various failure modes, e.g., missing
password in VPD, are detailed later in this section.

![System boot flowchart](img/fail-secure.svg)

 1. Before mounting the `/cfg` and `/var` file systems, which host the
    read-writable data like `startup-config` and container images, the
	system checks if it's time for a factory reset.  If so it wipes the
	contents of these partitions before proceeding
 2. Linux boots with a device tree which is used for detecting generic
    make and model of the device, e.g., number of interfaces.  It may
    also reference an EEPROM with [Vital Product Data](vpd.md).  That is
    where the base MAC address and per-device password hash is stored.
    (Generic builds use the same MAC address and password)
 3. On every boot the system's `factory-config` and `failure-config` are
    generated from the YANG[^1] models of the current firmware version.
    This ensures that a factory reset device can always boot, and that
    there is a working fail safe, or rather *fail secure*, mode
 4. On first power-on, and after a factory reset, the system does not
    have a `startup-config`, in which case `factory-config` is copied
	to `startup-config`
 5. Provided the integrity of the `startup-config` is OK, a system
    service loads and activates the configuration

### Failure Modes

So, what happens if any of the steps above fail?

**VPD Fail**

The per-device password cannot be read, or is corrupt, so the system
`factory-config` and `failure-config` are not generated:

 1. First boot, or after factory reset: `startup-config` cannot be
    created or loaded, and `failure-config` cannot be loaded.  The
	system ends up in an unrecoverable state, i.e., **RMA[^2] Mode**
 2. The system has booted (at least) once with correct VPD and password
    and already has a `startup-config`.  Provided the `startup-config`
	is OK (see below), it is loaded and system boots successfully

In both cases, external factory reset modes/button will not help, and
in the second case will cause the device to fail on the next boot.

> The second case does not yet have any warning or event that can be
> detected from the outside.  This is planned for a later release.

**Broken startup-config**

If loading `startup-config` fails for some reason, e.g., invalid JSON
syntax, failed validation against the system's YANG model, or a bug in
the system's `confd` service, the *Fail Secure Mode* is triggered and
`failure-config` is loaded (unless VPD Failure, see above).

*Fail Secure Mode* is a fail-safe mode provided for debugging the
system.  Depending on customer requirements this may be either the
`factory-config` with the hostname set to `failure`, or a dedicated
configuration that isolates interfaces, or even disables ports, to
ensure that the device does not cause any security problems on the
network.  E.g., start forwarding traffic between previously isolated
VLANs.

The generic default is isolated interfaces with communication only to
the management CPU, SSH and console login using the device's factory
reset password, IP connectivity only using IPv6 link-local, and device
discovery protocols: LLDP, mDNS-SD.  The login and shell prompt are set
to `failure-c0-ff-ee`, the last three octets of the device's base MAC
address.

    SNMP (MIB), used to describe the subsystems and properties of
	the system.
