Introduction
------------

Default builds of Infix do not enable any container support.  See below
section, [Enabling Container Support](#enabling-container-support), for
details on how to enable it using Podman.

Networking in containers is provided by both Infix and the Container
Network Interface ([CNI](https://www.cni.dev/)) that Podman supports.

> A convenience alias `docker=podman` is available in Infix, remember,
> not all features or syntax of docker is available in podman.


Docker Containers with Podman
-----------------------------

We assume you've booted into Infix and start with a familiar example.
This downloads the `hello-world` example container image and runs it:

    podman run -it --rm docker://hello-world

We can also set up a port forward to a little web server:

    podman run -d --rm -p 80:80 docker://nginx:alpine

In detached (`-d`) state you can check the status using `podman ps` and
try to connect to the web server:

    curl http://localhost

or connect to port 80 of your running Infix system with a browser.  See
the following sections for how to add more interfaces and start/stop the
container at boot/reboot.

### Multiple Networks

It is also possible to start a container with multiple networks.  The
approach shown here uses CNI profiles, which means the interfaces names
inside the container will always be: `eth0`, `eth1`, etc.

A common setup is to use a VETH pair, with one end in the container and
the other end routed, or bridged, to the rest of the world.  The Infix
[CLI Guide](cli/introduction.md) provides examples of both.  In either case you need
to create a matching CNI profile for one end of the VETH pair before
starting the container, here we use two network profiles, the default
podman bridge and the VETH profile:

     cni create host net1 veth0a 192.168.0.42/24
     podman run -d --rm --net=podman,net1 --entrypoint "/linuxrc" \
             --privileged docker://troglobit/buildroot:latest

The first profile (`podman`) is a the default bridged profile.  When a
container is started with that (default behavior), podman dynamically
creates a VETH pair which has one end attached as a bridge port in the
`cni-podman0` bridge managed by podman, and the other end is brought up
as `eth0` inside the container.

The second profile is the one we created, it uses the `host-device`
profile and does not create anything, it simply lifts the peer end of
the pair into the container as `eth1`.  This CNI profile can also be
used to hand over control of physical ports to a container.

> **Note:** here we start the container in `--privileged` mode.  This
> allows the container guest unfiltered access to the host system and it
> might not be what you want for a production system.  For that at least
> SECCOMP is recommended, which is out of scope for this tutorial.

### Real Example

To be able to preserve state in containers between reboots we need a
writable layer, this is done with `podman create`, after which we can
use `podman start`.   We build on the previous example:

    cni create host net1 veth0a 192.168.0.42/24
    podman create --name system --conmon-pidfile=/run/pod:system.pid \
           --restart=no --systemd=false --tz=local --privileged      \
           --net=podman,net1 --entrypoint "/linuxrc" -p 222:22       \
           docker://troglobit/buildroot:latest

Here we map the host port 222 to the SSH port of the container, but one
can just as easily map the host's port 22 (SSH).  Just make sure to
first disable the host's SSH service.

> **Note:** the new options used here are required for enabling
> monitoring and automate start/stop of containers at boot/reboot.

This creates the named container `system` which we can now start:

    podman start system

and stop:

    podman stop system

For this particular image[^1] we need to modify its defaults a bit,
because it is set up to run a DHCP client on the first Ethernet
interface, which in our case is the `podman` default CNI bridge.  In
fact, we don't want the container to set up any networking since that is
handled by Infix and podman.

    root@infix-12-34-56:~$ podman start system
    root@infix-12-34-56:~$ podman exec -it system sh
    / # rm -rf /etc/network/interfaces
    / # exit
    root@infix-12-34-56:~$ podman stop system

The change is now saved in the writable layer and the next time the
container is started it will look like this:

    root@infix-12-34-56:~$ podman start system
    root@infix-12-34-56:~$ podman exec -it system sh
    / # ifconfig
    eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr A2:32:4C:2B:5E:51
              inet addr:10.88.0.11  Bcast:10.88.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0
              inet6 addr: fe80::a032:4cff:fe2b:5e51/64 Scope:Link

              RX bytes:48240 (47.1 KiB)  TX bytes:1102 (1.0 KiB)
    
    eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 56:B5:4E:D1:9C:E5
              inet addr:192.168.0.42  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
              inet6 addr: fe80::54b5:4eff:fed1:9ce5/64 Scope:Link

              RX bytes:60926 (59.4 KiB)  TX bytes:1377 (1.3 KiB)

Automating start/stop at boot/reboot is documented in the next section.

[^1]: A common task one has to do for many other standard images, e.g.,
    Alpine Linux and BusyBox available on Docker Hub.

### Hybrid Mode

Since container setup and configuration is not modeled in YANG yet, we
use the Infix *Hybrid mode*, described in [Infix Variants](variant.md).

To start containers in *Hybrid Mode*, provided the images have been
downloaded with `podman pull docker://troglobit/buildroot:latest` and
a container created (above):

```
root@infix:/cfg/start.d$ cat <<EOF >20-enable-container.sh
#!/bin/sh
# Remember to create the veth0a <--> vet0b pair in the CLI first!
cni create host net1 veth0a 192.168.0.42/24
cat <<EOF > /etc/finit.d/available/pod:system.conf
service name:pod :system pid:!/run/pod:system.pid podman --syslog start system -- System container
EOF
initctl enable pod:system
exit 0
root@infix:/cfg/start.d$ chmod +x 20-enable-container.sh
```

Reboot to activate the changes.  To activate the changes without
rebooting, run the script and call `initctl reload`.

> **Note:** the `/etc` directory is a `tmpfs` ramdisk and contents will
> be lost on reboot, so to retain custom CNI profiles after reboot you
> need to either save them and restore in the script above, or recreate
> them on every boot.


Enabling Container Support
--------------------------

Container support is not enabled by default because it is not a common
customer feature, it also prolongs build times a lot due to bringing in
a build-time dependency on Go.

However, customer specific builds may have it, and you can also roll
your own based on any of the available `defconfigs`.  For example:

    cd infix/
    make x86_64_defconfig

Run menuconfig, search for `podman` using `/`, enable it and build:

	make menuconfig
	...
	make

Enabling [podman][] select `crun`, `conmon`, and all other dependencies.
The build will take a while, but eventually you can:

    make run


Debugging Containers
--------------------

If the host system is not powered down or rebooted properly, containers
may not start up as they should on the following boot.  Below is a very
common problem and solution shown.

```
root@infix-12-34-56:~$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE       COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
root@infix-12-34-56:~$ grep nginx /var/log/syslog
Jun 25 10:15:48 infix-12-34-56 finit[1]: Service pod:nginx[2376] died, restarting in 5000 msec (10/10)
Jun 25 10:15:48 infix-12-34-56 finit[1]: Starting pod:nginx[2408]
Jun 25 10:15:53 infix-12-34-56 finit[1]: Service pod:nginx keeps crashing, not restarting.
```

If this the system is isolated from remote network access, start by
verifying the image is downloaded:

```
root@infix-12-34-56:/cfg/start.d$ podman images
REPOSITORY                     TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED      SIZE
docker.io/library/nginx        alpine      4937520ae206  10 days ago  43.2 MB
docker.io/troglobit/buildroot  latest      68faf6b20f1a  6 weeks ago  41.4 MB
```

OK, let's see what the `podman-service` step (above) created:

```
root@infix-12-34-56:/cfg/start.d$ initctl show pod-nginx.conf
service name:pod :nginx podman run --name nginx --rm  -p 80:80 nginx:alpine   -- Nginx container
```

Try starting the container manually.  Remember to add the `-d` flag to
emulate detached/background operation:

```
root@infix-12-34-56:/cfg/start.d$ podman run --name nginx --rm -d -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine
Error: creating container storage: the container name "nginx" is already in use by 9c73bd8d505b1585d241595bfadede361b87f6c1be9a5656253b5a4d73da57e0. You have to remove that container to be able to reuse that name: that name is already in use
```

Aha, a lingering image with the same name!  Where is it?

```
root@infix-12-34-56:/cfg/start.d$ podman ps --all
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                 COMMAND               CREATED            STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES

```

Oh, we have two lingering containers that were created but did not stop
correctly.  Let's remove them:

```
root@infix-12-34-56:/cfg/start.d$ docker rm -f 9c73bd8d505b
9c73bd8d505b
root@infix-12-34-56:/cfg/start.d$ docker rm -f 8a5290504ebc
8a5290504ebc
```

Now we can manually restart the (supervised) container:

```
root@infix-12-34-56:/cfg/start.d$ initctl restart pod:nginx
root@infix-12-34-56:/cfg/start.d$ initctl status pod:nginx
     Status : running
   Identity : pod:nginx
