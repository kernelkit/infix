Change Log
==========

All notable changes to the project are documented in this file.


[v24.08.0][UNRELEASED]
-------------------------

### Changes
- Initial RISC-V (riscv64) support: StarFive VisionFive2
- Massive updates to the NanoPi R2S:
  - Update Linux kernel to v6.10.3 and sync defconfig with aarch64
  - Workaround `reboot` command "hang" on NanoPi R2S (failure to reboot)
	by replacing the Rockchip watchdog driver with "softdog"
  - Update U-Boot to v2024.07, enable secure boot loading of images
  - Rename interfaces to LAN + WAN to match case and LEDs
  - Rename images to `infix-r2s$ver.ext`, not same as other aarch64
  - Change rootfs to squashfs for enhanced security
  - Add RAUC support to simplify device maintenance/upgrade
  - Add support for saving unique interface MAC addresses in U-Boot
  - Add support for system LEDs, see product's README
  - Add support for reset button from Linux, issues `reboot` atm.
  - Add static `factory-config` as an example
- Password login can now be disabled by removing the password.  Before
  this change only empty password disabled password login (in favor of
  SSH key login), removing the password locked the user completely out
- Add LED indication on factory reset, *all* LEDs available in Linux
  `/sys/class/leds` are turned on while clearing writable partitions
- Issue #158: enhance security of factory reset.  All file content
  is now overwritten x3, the last time with zeroes, then removed.  
  Example, on the NanoPi R2S this process takes ~30 seconds, but may
  take longer in setups with bigger configurations, e.g., containers

### Fixes
- Fix #274: add missing link/traffic LEDs on NanoPi R2S LAN port
- Fix #489: ensure all patches are versioned, including Linux kernel
- Fix #531: creating a new VLAN interface named `vlanN` should not set
  `lower-layer-if` to `vlanN`.  With the `vlanN` pattern, only C-VLAN
  and VID can be inferred
- Fix #542: warning message from `login`, cannot find `pam_lastlog.so`
- Silence bogus `sysctl` warnings at boot (syslog)
- Silence output from user group member check (sys-cli in syslog)


[v24.06.0][] - 2024-06-28
-------------------------

> **Note:** this release contains **breaking changes** in YANG models
> that are incompatible with existing configuration files.  So, after
> upgrade, but before reboot, a factory reset is required!

### Changes
- Upgrade Buildroot to 2024.02.3 (LTS)
- Upgrade Linux kernel to 6.6.34 (LTS)
- Upgrade bundled curiOS httpd container to v24.05.0
- Default web landing page refactored into a Buildroot package to make
  it possible to overload from customer repos.
- Enable DCB support in aarch64 kernel (for EtherType prio override)
- Topology mapper improvements, including option for deterministic
  reproduction of logical to physical mappings
- New version of `gencert` tool, for self signed HTTPS certificates.
  This allows dropping dependency on building a host rust toolchain
- Issue #374: add timestamps to dagger .log files
- Add small delay in U-Boot to allow stopping boot on reference boards
- Document how to provision the bootloader and Infix on a blank board
- Use initial hostname from `/etc/os-release` as configuration fallback
- Update documentation for use of VETH pairs in containers
- Issue #454: create bridges in `factory-config` with IGMP/MLD snooping
  enabled by default
- The following YANG models have been updated to newer draft versions:
  `ietf-crypto-types`, `ietf-keystore`, `ietf-netconf-server`, `ietf-ssh-common`,
  `ietf-ssh-server`, `ietf-tcp-client`, `ietf-tcp-common`, `ietf-tcp-server`,
  `ietf-tcp-server`, `ietf-tcp-server`, `ietf-tcp-server`.
  In these there are a lot of breaking changes, most likely
  you will need to redo your configuration from `factory-config`.
- The Augeas package has been dropped, so `augtool` is no longer available
- VLAN interfaces can now map the incoming PCP value to the
  kernel-internal priority on ingress, and perform the reverse mapping
  on egress.
- `mv88e6xxx` ports can now use Linux's priority information to select
  the appropriate egress queue, via the `mqprio` queuing discipline.
- Add logging of output from container start/stop action
- Clean up stale directories after OCI container archive import
- Add support for `show leaf-node` in CLI configure context
- Allow non-admin users to use the CLI.  NACM rules still apply
- Ensure filesystem is sync'ed properly after a CLI `copy` command
- Issue #178: add early boot script to migrate configuration files of
  older version to new syntax.  Initial, rudimentary support, for the
  change in shell types
- Issue #308: add `version` field to configuration file using a new
  model, infix-meta.yang.  Used to trigger migration from older formats
  to newer on future breaking changes
- Issue #432: extract YANG documentation at build time.  Part of the
  release tarballs is now `yangdoc.html` for the complete tree of all
  YANG configuration, operational data, RPCs, and notification nodes
- Issue #435: add support for `$factory$` password hash.  This allows
  backing up configuration files with device specific passwords.  Upon
  restore to another device this ensures the replacement's password is
  used instead of the originals'
- Issue #435: add support for hostname format specifiers.  The default
  hostname configuration is now `%h-%m` to encode, `infix-c0-ff-ee`
- Issue #435: support for "empty" NETCONF host keys.  Primarily used in
  static factory-config setups.  When a configuration is detected with
  this, the automatically generated, device specific 2048 bit RSA host
  key pair is used.  With this, vendor/product specific factory-config
  is now fully supported.  See `src/confd/README.md`
- Issue #447: add support for [yescrypt][], `$y$` hashes.  This also
  adds support for `$0$cleartext` password according to ietf-system.yang
- Issue #455: split CLI tutorial into multiple files for easy access
  from the CLI admin-exec context using the `help` command
- Issue #478: add operational support for ietf-system.yang, reading
  actual hostname and passwords after issue #435
- Merge infix-shell-types.yang with infix-system.yang
- cli: improved error/warning message on missing or incomplete command

### Fixes
- Fix #424: regression, root user can log in without password
- Fix build regressions in `cn9130_crb_boot_defconfig` caused by upgrade
  to Buildroot v2024.02 and recent multi-key support in RAUC and U-Boot
- Fix provisioning script after changes to make GRUB loading more robust
- Fix missing `/etc/resolv.conf`, as noticed by `avahi-daemon`, when a
  user calls `no system` from the CLI
- Fix #428: loss of admin account after upgrade to v24.04
- Fix #429: failing to load `startup-config` does not trigger the fail
  secure mode, causing the system to end up in an undefined state
- Fix #453: fix inconsistent behavior of custom MAC address (interface
  `phys-address` for VETH pairs.  Allows fixed MAC in containers
- Fix #462: increase port column width for CLI `show bridge mdb`
- Fix #468: non-admin users can get a POSIX shell as login shell, root
  cause was buggy Augeas library, replaced with plain C API.
- Fix #469: non-admin users added to *any* group get administrator
  privileges (added to UNIX `wheel` group)
- Fix #473: bridge interface with IPv6 SLAAC never get global prefix
- Fix #476: Custom command for containers not working
- Fix #479: timeout from underlying datastore when disabling containers
  in configuration.  Only disabling (stopping) container now done in the
  configuration change, removal of container done in the background
- Fix locking issue with standard counter groups on `mv88e6xxx`
- Add missing LICENSE hash for factory reset tool
- Fix timeout handling in container restart command
- Fix MDB/ATU synchronization issue from IGMPv3/MLDv2 reports on
  `mv88e6xxx` systems

[v24.04.0][] - 2024-04-30
-------------------------

**News:** this release marks the first major upgrade of the underlying
Buildroot to the latest LTS release, v2024.02.  This caused a few small
regressions in the release cycle, all known issues have been addressed.

Also worth highlighting, as of this release the Infix Classic variant
has been dropped.  It was the legacy Infix with manual configuration of
the system using a persistent `/etc`.  May be resurrected later as a
separate project.  Going forward Infix' focus is entirely on NETCONF.

Finally, the YANG Status section has been dropped for this release, the
idea is to generate supported features from the models and include in
future releases.

### Changes
- Bump the base Buildroot version to v2024.02 LTS
- Bump the base Linux kernel version to 6.6 LTS
- Drop Classic variant to reduce overhead, simplify build & release
  processes, and focus on NETCONF for Arm64 and Amd64 platforms
- Add hostname restrictions to ietf-system, and infix-dhcp-client
  models.  Max 64 characters on Linux systems
- Add mDNS CNAME (alias) advertisement, e.g., infix.local in addition to
  the default infix-c0-ff-ee.local.  Note: this is build-specific and
  does not change if system hostname is changed
- Add mDNS browser web application, https://network.local that shows all
  mDNS devices on the LAN.  The network.local mDNS name is also a CNAME,
  so with multiple Infix devices, only one will act as the mDNS browser
- Add temporary landing page to web server for https://infix.local
- Add web console using ttyd, https://infix.local:7681
- Add support for disabling web services using CLI
- The bridge model now has built-in validation of port memberships,
  i.e., a port must be a bridge member to be used in VLAN filtering
- The bridge model only permits the bridge itself to be a tagged
  member of VLANs -- meaning, the only way to set an IP address on
  such bridges is to use a VLAN interface on top
- A VLAN filtering bridge now validates that no IP address has been
  set.  Use a VLAN interface on top for that (see above)
- Restructure documentation, let first page in doc/ be table of contents
- Scripting Infix, new document on how to script Infix from remote,
  e.g., for production or from a container
- Introduction, update documentation now that the `admin` user's default
  login shell is `/bin/bash`
- System documentation, first outline of how to change hostname, add
  users, add system administrator users, changing login banner, change
  the system default editor, and more
- Network documentation, add section on VETH pairs
- Container documentation:
  - CLI prompts have been updated to match the examples used in other
    parts of the User Guide
  - Default route example for static container interfaces
  - How to upgrade a container image
- As a follow-up to port speed/duplex/autoneg support added in v24.02,
  this release ensures flow-control is always disabled on all Ethernet
  ports, as described in the IEEE Ethernet interfaces YANG model
- Add support for core dumps, saving them in `/var/crash`, max one dump
  per process, for use with future support tarballs
- Add support for multicast snooping, both IPv4 (IGMP) and IPv6 (MLD) in
  bridge setups, including offloading to switchdev
- Add support for acting as passive (proxy) or active IGMP querier
- Add support for static multicast filters, MAC, IPv4 and IPv6 groups
  are supported -- multicast snooping must be enabled
- Include Buildroot `legal-info` in releases, i.e., licenses, sources
  with patches, as well as csv files for packages and toolchain
- Drop `shell` command from CLI to allow confining users
- The CLI `copy` command now allows absolute paths
- Local resolver, `dnsmasq`, had port 53 visible from external `nmap`
  scans, even though it dropped non-local requests, it now only binds to
  the loopback interface reduce number of externally visible ports
- Kernel log messages, of severity error or higher, now log directly to
  the console.  This may cause some annoyance but has been enabled to
  ease debugging, in particular issues where the system crashes before
  the syslog daemon has flushed logs to disk.  (Logs are still saved to
  log files as well.)
- Issue #325: Add support for multiple administrator users by opening
  up basic NETCONF ACM support.  See documentation for details
  - Any user can be added to the `admin` NACM group
  - Any user *not* in the `admin` group is not allowed to have a login
    shell other than the CLI (or disabled).  POSIX shell, e.g., Bash is
	reserved for system administrators
- Issue #327: Remove IPv6LL from bridge port interfaces
- Issue #358: translate YANG model's LOWER-LAYER-DOWN -> LINK-DOWN in
  CLI `show interfaces` command
- Issue #360: document factory-config, startup-config, and the various
  failure modes in the system
- Issue #361: document how a privileged container can break out of its
  confinement and run host commands, e.g., call `sysrepocfg`
- Issue #365: add limited support for container capabilities, e.g., to
  enable `CAP_NET_RAW` to allow containers to use `ping`.  This allows
  users to avoid enabling privileged mode
- Issue #367: setting date/time over NETCONF now saves system time also
  to the RTC, which otherwise is only saved on reboot or power-down
- Issue #369: Remove limitation that the routing instance must be
  named 'default'

### Fixes
- confd: Fix memory leak when operating on candidate configuration
- probe: Fix crash on systems without USB
- Reduced syslog errors for accesses no non-existing xpaths
- Fix bogus warning about not properly updating `/etc/motd` in new
  `motd-banner` setting, introduced in v24.02.0
- infix-routing model: the `enable` configuration setting for OSPF, in
  `default-route-advertise` has been obsoleted and replaced by `enabled`
- Fix #328: when setting up a VLAN filtering bridge, the PVID for bridge
  ports defaulted to 1, making it impossible to set up "tagged-only"
  ports which drop ingressing untagged traffic
- Fix #329: VLAN inference for interfaces named `eth0.1`, i.e., VID 1 on
  lower-layer-if `eth0`.  Only affects automatic inference in the CLI,
  entering the values manually (CLI/NETCONF) not affected by this bug
- Fix #331: inconsistent naming of 'enabled' in infix-routing.yang
- Fix #349: minor changes to `bridge-port` settings, like setting `pvid`
  when you forget it, did not take without a reboot
- Fix #353: impossible to remove bridge port with `no bridge-port`
- Fix #358: MAC address no longer shown for bridge interfaces in CLI
  `show interfaces` command
- Fix #365: not possible to run `ping` from container
- Fix #366: static routes from container host interfaces do not work.
  Documentation updated with an example
- Fix #368: upgrading `oci-archive:/` images fail because system thinks
  the image can be pulled from a localhost registry.  Documentation has
  also been updated, describing various methods and how to upgrade them
- Fix #370: despite the documentation stating containers must explicitly
  declare `network` settings, Infix v23.02 had a late regression that
  reverted back to the podman default: network behind a CNI bridge
  (firewalled and NAT:ed, hidden from the rest of the network)
- Fix #375: k8s-logger, used for containers, does not exit properly and
  causes 100% CPU load when container stop or are restarted.  Also in
  this issue: handle ip/route additions to container networks at runtime
- Fix #384: segfault in helper function when disabling the DHCP client
  using `no dhcp-client` from the CLI
- Fix #391 Creating VLAN interface in the CLI with "edit interface vlanN"
  does not set VLAN id to N.
- Fix #404: `lldpd` should be disabled on internal interface `dsa0`
- Fix #406: an overly restrictive `when` expression in the bridge YANG
  model prevented users from adding VLAN interfaces as bridge ports.
  E.g., creating interface `eth0.10` and adding that to `br0`
- Fix #412: after starting up with DHCP client enabled on any interface
  `set dhcp-client enabled false` does not bite at runtime
- Fix #414: spelling error in `infix-hardware.yang`, leaf node `coutry`
- Fix #415: `startup-config` owned by `root` user and group instead of
  `admin`.  The file ownership is now adjusted on every boot
- Fix #416: `admin` user cannot perform a factory reset with RPC using
  `sysrepocfg` tool over SSH
- Fix bogus syslog warning about not updating `/etc/motd` properly


[v24.02.0][] - 2024-03-01
-------------------------

> **Note:** the `root` account is disabled in official builds.  Only the
> `admin` user can log in to the system.  This can be changed, but only
> in developer builds: `make menuconfig` -> System configuration ->
> `[*]Enable root login with password`

### YANG Status

Infix devices support downloading all YANG models over NETCONF, including
models with submodules.  As a rule, standard models are used as long as
they map to underlying Linux concepts and services.  All exceptions are
listed in Infix specific models, detailing deviations and augmentations.

Currently supported models:

 - [ieee802-ethernet-interface][]:
   - Toggle port speed & duplex auto-negotiation on/off
   - Set port speed and duplex when auto-negotiation is off
   - Query port speed/duplex and auto-negotiation status (operational)
   - **Frame counters:**

### Changes

- New hardware support: NanoPi R2S from FriendlyELEC, a simple two-port router
- Static routing support, now also for IPv6
- Dynamic routing support with OSPFv2, limited (see `infix-routing.yang` for
  deviations), but still usable in most relevant use-cases.  If you are using
  this and are interested in more features, please let us know!
  - Multiple area support, including different area types
  - Route redistribution
  - Default route injection
  - Full integration with Bidirectional Forward Detection (BFD)
  - Operational status, including but not limited to:
    * OSPF Router ID
    * Neighbor status
    * OSPF routing table
	* Interface type, incl. passive status
  - For more information, see `doc/networking.md`
- Support for disabling USB ports in `startup-config` (no auto-mount yet!)
- Initial support for Docker containers, see documentation for details:
  - Custom Infix model, see `infix-containers.yang` for details
  - Add image URL/location and volumes/mounts/interfaces to configuration,
    the system ensures the image is downloaded and container created in the
	background before launching it.  If now networking is available the job
	is queued and retried every time a new network route is learned
  - Status and actions (stop/start/restart) available in operational datastore
  - Possible to move physical switch ports inside container, see docs
  - Possible to bundle OCI archives in Infix image, as well as storing any
    file content in `factory-config` to override container image defaults
- IEEE Ethernet interface:
  - Support for setting port speed/duplex or auto-negotiating
  - New per-port counters, augments to IEEE model added in infix-ethernet.yang:
    `in-good-octets`, `out-good-octets`
- Many updates to DHCPv4 client YANG model:
  - new options, see `infix-dhcp-client.yang` for details:
    - Default options: subnet, router, dns+domain, hostname, broadcast, ntpsrv
    - Set NTP servers, require NTP client in ietf-system to be enabled, will
	  be treated as non-preferred sources, configured `prefer` servers wins
    - Learn DNS servers, statically configured servers always takes precedence
    - Install routes, not only from option 3, but also options 121 and 249
  - Support for ARP:ing for client lease (default enabled)
  - Configurable route metrics, by default metric 100 to allow static routes
    to win over DHCP routes, useful for backup DHCP connections
- IETF Hardware data: added YANG model for vital product data representation,
  and augments for initial USB support (enable/disable)
- IETF System:
  - the `motd` augment in `infix-system.yang` for *Message of the Day* has
    been marked as obsolete and replaced with `motd-banner`.  The new setting
    is of type *binary* and allows control codes and multi-line content to be
    stored.  The legacy `motd` will remain for the foreseeable future and
    takes precedence over the new `motd-banner` setting
  - new `text-editor` augment in `infix-system.yang` to select the backend for
    the new `text-editor` command: `emacs`, `nano`, or `vi`
- Many updates to the test system, *Infamy*, incl. new Quick Start Guide in
  updated `doc/testing.md` to help new developers get started
- Add `htop` to default builds, useful for observing and attaching (strace)
- Change the default shell of the `admin` user from `clish` to `bash`.  Change
  required for factory production and provisioning reasons.  Only affects the
  built-in default, customer specific `factory-config`'s are not affected!
- CLI: the `set` command on a boolean can now be used without an argument,
  `set boolean` sets the boolean option to true
- CLI: new command `change`, for use with ietf-system user passwords, starts
  an interactive password dialog, including confirmation entry.  The resulting
  password is by default salted and hashed using sha512crypt
- CLI: new command `text-editor`, for use with binary fields, e.g., `content`
  for file mounts in containers, or the new `motd-banner`:

        admin@infix-c0-ff-ee:/config/system/> text-editor motd-banner
        ... exit with Ctrl-x Ctrl-c ...
        admin@infix-c0-ff-ee:/config/system/> show
        motd-banner VGhpcyByZWxlYXNlIHdhcyBzcG9uc29yZWQgYnkgQWRkaXZhIEVsZWt0cm9uaWsK;

- CLI: new admin-exec command `show ntp [sources]`
- CLI: new admin-exec command `show dns` to display DNS client status
- CLI: new admin-exec command `show ospf [subcommand]`
- CLI: new admin-exec command `show container [subcommand]`
- CLI: new admin-exec command `show hardware` only USB port status for now
- CLI: updates to the `show interfaces` command to better list bridge VLANs

### Fixes

- Fix #177: ensure bridge is not bridge port to itself
- Fix #259: failure to `copy factory-config startup-config` in CLI
- Fix #278: allow DHCP client to set system hostname (be careful)
- Fix #283: hostname in DHCP request adds quotation marks
- Fix #294: drop stray `v` from version suffix in release artifacts
- Fix #298: drop privileges properly before launching user `shell` in CLI
- Fix #312: race condition in `ipv4_autoconf.py`, causes test to block forever
- Backport upstream fix to netopeer2-server for fetching YANG models that
  refer to submodules over NETCONF
- CLI: drop developer debug in `set` command
- Fix out-of-place `[OK]` messages at shutdown/reboot
- Fix garbled syslog messages due to unicode in Infix tagline, drop unicode


[v23.11.0][] - 2023-11-30
-------------------------

> **Note:** this is the first release where the `root` account is disabled in
> default builds.  Only the `admin` user, generated from `factory-config`, can

### Changes

- The CLI built-in command `password generate` has been changed to use the
  secure mode of the `pwgen` tool, and 13 chars for increased entropy
- The `qemu.sh -c` command, available in developer builds and the release zip,
  can now be used to modify the RAM size and enable VPD emulation
- Add support for overriding generated factory defaults in derivatives
  using a `/etc/confdrc.lcocal` file -- incl. updated branding docs.
- Add support for detecting factory reset condition from a bootloader
- Ensure `/var` is also cleared (properly) during factory reset
- Add support for port auto-negotiation status in operational datastore
- Add CLI support for showing veth pairs in `show interfaces`
- Speedups to CLI detailed view of a single interface
- Updated documentation of VLAN interfaces and VLAN filtering bridge
- Updated documentation for how to customize services in *Hybrid Mode*
- In RMA mode (runlevel 9), the system no longer has any login services
- Disable `root` login in all NETCONF builds, only `admin` available
- Add support for VPD data in ONIE EEPROM format
- Add `iito`, the intelligent input/output daemon for LED control
- Add port autoneg and speed/duplex status to operational data
- Upgrade Linux to v6.5.11, with kkit extensions
- Add support for static IPv4 routing using `ietf-routing@2018-03-13.yang` and
  `ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing@2018-03-13.yang`, one `default` instance only
- Add support for partitioning and self-provisioning of new devices
- Add support for reading `admin` user's default password from VPD.  Devices
  that do not have a VPD can set a password hash in the device tree
- Add support for upgrading software bundles (images) from the CLI.
  Supported remote servers: ftp, tftp, and http/https.
- Traversing the CLI configure context has been simplified by collapsing all
  YANG containers that only contain a single list element.  Example:
  `edit interfaces interface eth0` becomes `edit interface eth0`
- Add CLI support for creating configuration backups and transferring files
  to/from remote servers: tftp, ftp, http/https (download only). Issue #155
- Add `_netconf-ssh._tcp` record to mDNS-SD

### Fixes

- Fix #111: fix auto-inference of dynamic interface types (bridge, veth)
- Fix #125: improved feedback on invalid input in configure context
- Fix #198: drop bridge default PVID setting, for VLAN filtering bridge.
  All bridge ports must have explicit VLAN assignment (security)
- Fix #215: impossible to enable NTP client, regression from v23.06.0
- Fix regression in CLI `show factory-config` command
- Fix missing version in `/etc/os-release` variable `PRETTY_NAME`
- Fix failure to start `podman` in GNS3 (missing Ext4 filesystem feature)
- Fix initial terminal size probing in CLI when logging in from console port
- Fix CLI `show running-config`, use proper JSON format like other files
- Fix caching of libyang module references in confd.  Loading other plugins to
  sysrepo-plugind modifies these references, which may can cause corruption
- Fix missing `v` in `VERSION`, `VERSION_ID`, and `IMAGE_VERSION` in
  `/etc/os-release` and other generated files for release builds.

### Changes

- Add support for setting/querying IPv4/IPv6 MTU, see #152 for details.
- Add support for *Fail Secure Mode*: if loading `startup-config` fails,
  e.g. YANG model validation failure after upgrade, the system now falls back
  to load `failure-config` instead of just crashing.  This config, along with
  `factory-config`, is generated on every boot to match the active image's
  YANG models.  In case neither config can be loaded, or even bootstrapping
  YANG models fail, the system will go into an RMA state -- Return to
  Manufacturer, clearly signaled on the console and, on devices that support
  it, angry LED signaling.  See #154 for more.
- Add support for generating GNS3 appliance file for NETCONF Aarch64.
- Add support for UTC offset (+/- HH:00) in `ietf-system`, PR #174
- Add support for `ietf-factory-default` RPC, PR #175
- Add support for performing factory reset (using #175 RPC) from CLI
- Replace `ietf-if-vlan-encapsulation` YANG model with the native
  `infix-if-vlan` model.  This fits better with Linux VLAN interfaces and
  simplifies the syntax greatly.  For details, see PR #179

        admin@example:/config/interfaces/interface/eth0.10/> set vlan id 10 lower-layer-if eth0

- The following new NETCONF interface operational counters have been added:

| **YANG**                    | **Linux / Ethtool**               |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `out-frames`                | `FramesTransmittedOK`             |
| `out-multicast-frames`      | `MulticastFramesXmittedOK`        |

| `in-total-frames`           | `FramesReceivedOK`                |
|                             | + `FrameCheckSequenceErrors`      |
|                             | + `FramesLostDueToIntMACRcvError` |

|                             | + `etherStatsOversizePkts`        |
|                             | + `etherStatsJabbers`             |
| `in-frames`                 | `FramesReceivedOK`                |
| `in-multicast-frames`       | `MulticastFramesReceivedOK`       |
| `in-broadcast-frames`       | `BroadcastFramesReceivedOK`       |
| `in-error-undersize-frames` | `undersize_pkts`                  |
| `in-error-fcs-frames`       | `FrameCheckSequenceErrors`        |

- Greatly improved branding support using `make menuconfig`.  All the
  identifying strings, including firmware image, is in `/etc/os-release`, will
  be used in CLI `show system-information`, the WebUI About dialog, and any
  prominent areas when booting up (on console), logging in to CLI and WebUI.
- IGMP/MLD snooping is now disabled by default on new bridges.  Support
  for multicast filtering bridges expected no later than v24.01.
- The SSDP responder, device discovery in Windows, has been removed in favor
  of Windows 10 (build 1709) native support for mDNS-SD.  Details in #166
- A GreenPAK programmer has been added, not enabled by default.  This is a
  popular programmable little chip from Renesas.  Worth a look!
- The `confd` script `gen-interfaces` can now generate bridges and stand-alone
  interfaces with IPv6 (SLAAC) for `factory-config` et al.
- Drop `x86_64_minimal_defconfig`, previously used for regression tests only
- Documentation updates of how IPv4/IPv6 addresses are shown in NETCONF
  operational data, as well as the built-in CLI, see #163 for details.

### Fixes

- Fix #106: confd: drop deviation `ietf-system:timezone-utc-offset`
- Fix #151: Operational status broken in v23.09
- Fix #159: Hacky generation of `/etc/resolv.conf` at boot
- Fix #162: VLAN interface without encapsulation is accepted by YANG model

	 - `/if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:address/ip:status`
	 - `/if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:mtu`
	 - `/if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:mtu`
	 - `/if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:neighbor`
     - `/if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:neighbor`
   - [ietf-if-vlan-encapsulation][]: Linux VLAN interfaces, e.g. `eth0.10`
   - [infix-if-bridge][]: Linux bridge interfaces with native VLAN support
   - [infix-if-veth][]: Linux VETH pairs
   - [infix-if-type][]: deviation for interface types, limiting number
     to supported types only.  New identities are derived from default
     IANA interface types, ensuring compatibility with other standard
     models, e.g., `ieee802-ethernet-interface.yang`
 - Configurable services:
   - [ieee802-dot1ab-lldp][]: stripped down to an `enabled` setting
   - [infix-services][]: support for enabling mDNS and SSDP discovery

### Changes

- The following new NETCONF interface operational status have been added:
  - admin-status
  - IP address origin (dhcp, static, link-layer, random, other)
  - bridge
  - parent-interface
  - basic statistics (`in_octets`, `out_octets`)
- Support for custom interface `phys-address` (MAC address)
- The CLI admin-exec command `show interfaces` now fully uses NETCONF
  operational data to display both available interfaces and all of their
  IP addresses.  Displaying an individual interface will show more info.
- The CLI admin-exec command `password encrypt` now default to SHA512

### Fixes

- Fix #136: IPv6 autoconf `create-global-addresses true` does not bite
- Fix #138: Not possible to have static IP and DHCP at the same time
- Minor fixes and updates to documentation (faulty links, references)
- The `sync-fork.yml` workflow has finally been fixed.


[v23.08.0][] - 2023-08-31

   - [infix-system][]: timezone-name deviation, replaced with IANA timezones
   - [infix-system][]: username deviation, clarifying Linux restrictions
   - [infix-system][]: deviations for unsupported features, e.g. RADIUS
 - [ietf-interfaces][]:
   - [ietf-ip][]: augmented with IPv4LL similar to standardized IPv6LL
   - [ietf-if-vlan-encapsulation][]: Linux VLAN interfaces, e.g. `eth0.10`
   - [infix-if-bridge][]: Linux bridge interfaces with native VLAN support
   - [infix-if-veth][]: Linux VETH pairs

[v23.06.0][] - 2023-06-23
-------------------------

Midsummer release.  The first official Infix release, based on [Buildroot
2023.02.2][br2023.02.2], with NETCONF support using the [sysrepo][] and
[netopeer2][].

Supported YANG models in addition to those used by sysrepo and netopeer:

 - [ietf-system][]
   - Everything except radius authentication and timezone-utc-offset
   - Augmented with MotD (Message of the Day), Infix YANG model
 - [ietf-interfaces][]
   - [ietf-ip][] augmented with IPv4LL similar to standardized IPv6LL
   - [ietf-if-vlan-encapsulation][], Linux VLAN interfaces, e.g. `eth0.10`
   - Linux bridge interfaces with native VLAN support, Infix YANG model
   - Linux VETH pairs, Infix YANG model

> **DISCLAIMER:** the [Infix YANG models for Linux][yang23.06], are
> still under heavy development.  New revisions are expected which may
> not be backwards compatible.  When upgrading to a new release, test on
> a GNS3 staging environment first, or start over from a factory reset.
