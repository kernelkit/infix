# Network Configuration

Infix aims to support all Linux Networking constructs.  The YANG models
used to describe the system are chosen to fit well and leverage the
underlying Linux kernel's capabilities.  The [ietf-interfaces.yang][1]
model forms the base, extended with [ietf-ip.yang][2] and other layer-3
IETF models.  The layer-2 bridge and aggregate models are defined by
Infix to exploit the unique features not available in IEEE models.

## Data Plane

The blocks you choose, and how you connect them, defines your data plane.
Here we see an example of how to bridge a virtual port with a physical
LAN.

![Example of a 4-port switch with a link aggregate and a VETH pair to a container](img/dataplane.svg)

Depending on the (optional) VLAN filtering of the bridge, the container
may have full or limited connectivity with outside ports, as well as the
internal CPU.

In fact the virtual port connected to the bridge can be member of
several VLANs, with each VLAN being an interface with an IP address
inside the container.

Thanks to Linux, and technologies like switchdev, that allow you to
split a switching fabric into unique (isolated) ports, the full
separation and virtualization of all Ethernet layer properties are
possible to share with a container.  Meaning, all the building blocks
used on the left hand side can also be used freely on the right hand
side as well.

### Bridging

This is the most central part of the system.  A bridge is a switch, and
a switch is a bridge.  In Linux, setting up a bridge with ports
connected to physical switch fabric, means you manage the actual switch
fabric!

In Infix ports are by default not switch ports, unless the customer
specific factory config sets it up this way.  To enable switching
between ports you create a bridge and then add ports to that
bridge. That's it.

```
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit interface br0
admin@example:/config/interface/br0/> up
admin@example:/config/> set interface eth0 bridge-port bridge br0
admin@example:/config/> set interface eth1 bridge-port bridge br0
admin@example:/config/> leave
```

Here we add two ports to bridge `br0`: `eth0` and `eth1`.

> **Note:** Infix has many built-in helpers controlled by convention.
> E.g., if you name your bridge `brN`, where `N` is a number, Infix sets
> the interface type automatically and unlocks all bridge features.
> Other "magic" names are `ethN.M` for VLAN M on top of `ethN`, or
> `dockerN` to create an IP masquerading container bridge.

#### VLAN Filtering Bridge

By default bridges in Linux do not filter based on VLAN tags.  It can be
enabled in Infix when creating a bridge by adding a port to a VLAN as a
tagged or untagged member.  Use the port default VID (PVID) setting to
control VLAN association for traffic ingressing a port untagged (default
PVID: 1).

```
admin@example:/config/> edit interface br0
admin@example:/config/interface/br0/> up
admin@example:/config/> set interface eth0 bridge-port bridge br0
admin@example:/config/> set interface eth0 bridge-port pvid 10
admin@example:/config interface eth1 bridge-port bridge br0
admin@example:/config/> set interface eth1 bridge-port pvid 20
admin@example:/config/> edit interface br0
admin@example:/config/interface/br0/> set bridge vlans vlan 10 untagged eth0
admin@example:/config/interface/br0/> set bridge vlans vlan 20 untagged eth1
```

This sets `eth0` as an untagged member of VLAN 10 and `eth1` as an
untagged member of VLAN 20.  Switching between these ports is thus
prohibited.

To terminate a VLAN in the switch itself, either for switch management
or for routing, the bridge must become a (tagged) member of the VLAN.

```
admin@example:/config/interface/br0/> set bridge vlans vlan 10 tagged br0
admin@example:/config/interface/br0/> set bridge vlans vlan 20 tagged br0
```

> To route or to manage via a VLAN, a VLAN interface needs to be created
> on top of the bridge, see section [VLAN Interfaces](#vlan-interfaces)
> below for more on this topic.

#### Multicast Filtering and Snooping

Multicast filtering in the bridge is handled by the bridge itself.  It
can filter both IP multicast and MAC multicast.  For IP multicast it
also supports "snooping", i.e., IGMP and MLD, to automatically reduce
the broadcast effects of multicast.  See the next section for a summary
of the [terminology used](#terminology--abbreviations).

> **Note:** currently there is no way to just enable multicast filtering
> without also enabling snooping.  This may change in the future, in
> which case a `filtering` enabled setting will be made available along
> with the existing `snooping` setting.

When creating your bridge you must decide if you need a VLAN filtering
bridge or a plain bridge (see previous section).  Multicast filtering is
supported for either, but take note that it must be enabled and set up
per VLAN when VLAN filtering is enabled -- there are no global multicast
settings in this operating mode.

In the following example we have a regular 8-port bridge without VLAN
filtering.  We focus on the multicast specific settings:

```
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit interface br0
admin@example:/config/interface/br0/> set bridge multicast snooping
admin@example:/config/interface/br0/> set ipv4 address 192.168.2.1 prefix-length 24
admin@example:/config/interface/br0/> leave
admin@example:/> copy running-config startup-config
```

Here we enable snooping and set a static IPv4 address so that the switch
can take part in IGMP querier elections.  (MLD querier election
currently not supported.)  We can inspect the current state:

```
admin@example:/> show ip multicast
Multicast Overview
Query Interval (default): 125 sec
Router Timeout          : 255
Fast Leave Ports        :
Router Ports            :
Flood Ports             : e0, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7

Interface       VID  Querier                     State  Interval  Timeout  Ver
br0                  192.168.2.1                    Up       125     None    3

Bridge          VID  Multicast Group       Ports
br0                  224.1.1.1             e3, e2
br0                  ff02::6a              br0
```

It is a small LAN, so our bridge has already become the elected IGMP
querier.  We see it is ours because the timeout is `None`, and we
recognize our IP address.  We can also see two ports that have joined
the same IPv4 multicast group, 224.1.1.1, and one join from Infix itself
for the IPv6 group ff02::6a.

Now, let's see what happens when we add another bridge, with VLAN
filtering enabled.  We skip the boring parts about how to move ports
e4-e7 to `br1` and assign them to VLANs, and again, focus on the
multicast bits only:

```
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit interface br1
admin@example:/config/interface/br1/> set bridge vlans vlan 1 multicast snooping
admin@example:/config/interface/br1/> set bridge vlans vlan 2 multicast snooping
admin@example:/config/interface/br1/> leave
admin@example:/> copy running-config startup-config
```

Let's see what we get:

```
admin@example:/> show ip multicast

br0                  ff02::6a              br0
br0                  ff02::1:ff00:0        br0
br1               1  224.1.1.1             e5
br1               2  224.1.1.1             e7
br1               1  ff02::fb              br1
br1               1  ff02::1:ff00:0        br1
```

In this setup we have a lot more going on.  Multiple multicast router
ports have been detected, and behind the scenes someone has also added
an IGMP/MLD fast-leave port.

##### Terminology & Abbreviations

 - **IGMP**: Internet Group Membership Protocol, multicast subscription
   for IPv4, for details see [RFC3376][]
 - **MLD**: Multicast Listener Discovery (Protocol), multicast
   subscription for IPv6, for details see [RFC3810][]
 - **Unknown/Unregistered multicast**: multicast groups that are *not*
   in the multicast forwarding database (MDB)
 - **Known/Registered multicast**: multicast groups that *are* in the
   multicast forwarding database (MDB)
 - **MDB**: the multicast forwarding database, consists of filters for
   multicast groups, directing where multicast is allowed to egress.  A
   filter entry consists of a group and a port list.  The bridge filters
   with a unique database per VLAN, in the same was as the unicast FDB
 - **Join/Leave**: the terminology used in earlier versions of the two
   protocols to subscribe and unsubscribe to a multicast group.  For
   more information, see *Membership Report*
 - **Membership Report** A membership report is sent by end-devices and
   forwarded by switches to the elected querier on the LAN.  They
   consist of multiple "join" and "leave" operations on groups.  They
   can also, per group, list which senders to allow or block.  Switches
   usually only support the group subscription, and even more common
   also only support filtering on the MAC level[^3]
 - **Querier election**: the process of determining who is the elected
   IGMP/MLD querier on a LAN.  Lowest numerical IP address wins, the
   special address 0.0.0.0 (proxy querier) never wins
 - **Proxy querier**: when no better querier exists on a LAN, one or
   more devices can send proxy queries with source address 0.0.0.0 (or
   :: for IPv6).  See **Query Interval**, below, why this is a good
   thing
 - **Query interval**: the time in seconds between two queries from an
   IGMP/MLD querier.  It is not uncommon that end-devices do not send
   their membership reports unless they first hear a query
 - **Fast Leave**: set on a bridge port to ensure multicast is pruned as
   quickly as possible when a "leave" membership report is received.  In
   effect, this option marks the port as directly connected to an
   end-device.  When not set (default), a query with timeout is first
   sent to ensure no unintentional loss of multicast is incurred
 - **Router port**: can be both configured statically and detected at
   runtime based on connected devices, usually multicast routers.  On
   a router port *all* multicast is forwarded, both known and unknown
 - **Flood port**: set on a bridge port (default: enabled) to ensure
   all *unknown* multicast is forwarded
 - **Router timeout**: the time in seconds until a querier is deemed to
   have been lost and another device (switch/router) takes over.  In the
   tables shown above, a *None* timeout is declared when the current
   device is the active querier

> **Note:** the reason why multicast flooding is enabled by default is
> to ensure safe co-existence with MAC multicast, which is very common
> in industrial networks.  It also allows end devices that do not know
> of IGMP/MLD to communicate over multicast as long as the group they
> have chosen is not used by other IGMP/MLD aware devices on the LAN.
>
> As soon as an IGMP/MLD membership report to "join" a group is received
> the group is added to the MDB and forwarding to other ports stop.  The
> only exception to this rule is multicast router ports.

### VLAN Interfaces

Creating a VLAN can be done in many ways. This section assumes VLAN
interfaces created atop another Linux interface.  E.g., the VLAN
interfaces created on top of the Ethernet interface or bridge in the
picture below.

![VLAN interface on top of Ethernet or Bridge interfaces](img/interface-vlan-variants.svg)

A VLAN interface is basically a filtering abstraction. When you run
`tcpdump` on a VLAN interface you will only see the frames matching the
VLAN ID of the interface, compared to *all* the VLAN IDs if you run
`tcpdump` on the lower-layer interface.

```
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit interface eth0.20
admin@example:/config/interface/eth0.20/> show
type vlan;
vlan {
  tag-type c-vlan;
  id 20;
  lower-layer-if eth0;
}
admin@example:/config/interface/eth0.20/> leave
```

The example below assumes bridge br0 is already created, see [VLAN
Filtering Bridge](#vlan-filtering-bridge).

```
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit interface vlan10
admin@example:/config/interface/vlan10/> set vlan id 10
admin@example:/config/interface/vlan10/> set vlan lower-layer-if br0
admin@example:/config/interface/vlan10/> leave
```

As conventions, a VLAN interface for VID 20 on top of an Ethernet
interface *eth0* is named *eth0.20*, and a VLAN interface for VID 10 on
top of a bridge interface *br0* is named *vlan10*.

> **Note:** If you name your VLAN interface `foo0.N` or `vlanN`, where `N` is a number, Infix will set the interface type automatically for you.


### Physical Ethernet Interfaces

#### Ethernet Settings and Status

Physical Ethernet interfaces provide low-level settings for speed/duplex as
well as packet status and statistics (*ieee802-ethernet-interface.yang*).

By default, Ethernet interfaces defaults to auto-negotiating
speed/duplex modes, advertising all speed and duplex modes available.
In the example below, the switch would by default auto-negotiate speed
1 Gbit/s on port eth1 and 100 Mbit/s on port eth4, as those are the
highest speeds supported by H1 and H2 respectively.

![4-port Gbit/s switch connected to Gbit and Fast Ethernet Hosts](img/ethernet-autoneg.svg)

The speed and duplex status for the links can be listed as shown
below, assuming the link operational status is 'up'. 

```
admin@example:/> show interfaces name eth1
name                : eth1
index               : 2
mtu                 : 1500
operational status  : up
auto-negotiation    : on
duplex              : full
speed               : 1000
physical address    : 00:53:00:06:11:01
ipv4 addresses      :
ipv6 addresses      : 
in-octets           : 75581
out-octets          : 43130
...
admin@example:/> show interfaces name eth4
name                : eth4
index               : 5
mtu                 : 1500
operational status  : up
auto-negotiation    : on
duplex              : full
speed               : 100
physical address    : 00:53:00:06:11:04
ipv4 addresses      :
ipv6 addresses      : 
in-octets           : 75439
out-octets          : 550704
...
admin@example:/>
```

#### Configuring fixed speed and duplex

Auto-negotiation of speed/duplex mode is desired in almost all
use-cases, but it is possible to disable auto-negotiation and specify
a fixed speed and duplex mode.

> If setting a fixed speed and duplex mode, ensure both sides of the
> link have matching configuration. If speed does not match, the link
> will not come up. If duplex mode does not match, the result is
> reported collisions and/or bad throughput.

The example below configures port eth3 to fixed speed 100 Mbit/s
half-duplex mode. 

```
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit interface eth3 ethernet
admin@example:/config/interface/eth3/ethernet/> set speed 0.1
admin@example:/config/interface/eth3/ethernet/> set duplex half
admin@example:/config/interface/eth3/ethernet/> set auto-negotiation enable false
admin@example:/config/interface/eth3/ethernet/> show
auto-negotiation {
  enable false;
}
duplex half;
speed 0.1;
admin@example:/config/interface/eth3/ethernet/> leave
admin@example:/> 
```

Speed metric is in Gbit/s.  Auto-negotiation needs to be disabled in
order for fixed speed/duplex to apply. Only speeds `0.1`(100 Mbit/s)
and `0.01` (10 Mbit/s) can be specified. 1 Gbit/s and higher speeds
require auto-negotiation to be enabled.

#### Ethernet statistics

Ethernet packet statistics can be listed as shown below.

```
admin@example:/> show interfaces name eth1
name                : eth1
index               : 2
mtu                 : 1500
operational status  : up
auto-negotiation    : on
duplex              : full
speed               : 1000
physical address    : 00:53:00:06:11:0a
ipv4 addresses      :
ipv6 addresses      : 
in-octets           : 75581
out-octets          : 43130

eth-in-frames                : 434
eth-in-multicast-frames      : 296
eth-in-broadcast-frames      : 138
eth-in-error-fcs-frames      : 0
eth-in-error-oversize-frames : 0
eth-out-frames               : 310
eth-out-multicast-frames     : 310
eth-out-broadcast-frames     : 0
eth-out-good-octets          : 76821
eth-in-good-octets           : 60598
admin@example:/> 
```


### VETH Pairs

A Virtual Ethernet (VETH) pair is basically a virtual Ethernet cable.  A
cable can be "plugged in" to a bridge and the other end can be given to
a [container](container.md), or plugged into another bridge.

The latter example is useful if you have multiple bridges in the system
with different properties (VLAN filtering, IEEE group forwarding, etc.),
but still want some way of communicating between these domains.

```
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit interface veth0a
admin@example:/config/interface/veth0a/> set veth peer veth0b
admin@example:/config/interface/veth0a/> end
admin@example:/config/> diff
interfaces {
+  interface veth0a {
+    type veth;
+    veth {
+      peer veth0b;
+    }
+  }
+  interface veth0b {
+    type veth;
+    veth {
+      peer veth0a;
+    }
+  }
}
admin@example:/config/>
```

> **Note:** this is another example of the automatic inference of the
> interface type from the name.  Any name can be used, but then you have
> to set the interface type to `veth` manually.


## Management Plane

This section details IP Addresses And Other Per-Interface IP settings.

Infix support several network interface types, each can be assigned one
or more IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.

![IP on top of network interface examples](img/ip-iface-examples.svg)

### IPv4 Address Assignment

Multiple address assignment methods are available:

| **Type**   | **Yang Model**    | **Description**                                                |
|:---------- |:----------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| static     | ietf-ip           | Static assignment of IPv4 address, e.g., *10.0.1.1/24*         |
| link-local | infix-ip          | Auto-assignment of IPv4 address in 169.254.x.x/16 range        |
| dhcp       | infix-dhcp-client | Assignment of IPv4 address by DHCP server, e.g., *10.0.1.1/24* |

Supported DHCP (request) options, configurability (Cfg) and defaults,
are listed below.  Configurable options can be disabled on a per client
interface basis, some options, like `clientid` and option 81, are
possible to set the value of as well.

| **Opt** | **Name**         | **Cfg** | **Description**                                     |

### IPv6 Address Assignment

Multiple address assignment methods are available:

| **Type**         | **Yang Model** | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
|:---------------- |:-------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| static           | ietf-ip        | Static assignment of IPv6 address, e.g., *2001:db8:0:1::1/64*                                                                                     |
| link-local       | ietf-ip[^2]    | (RFC4862) Auto-configured link-local IPv6 address (*fe80::0* prefix + interface identifier, e.g., *fe80::ccd2:82ff:fe52:728b/64*)                 |
| global auto-conf | ietf-ip        | (RFC4862) Auto-configured (stateless) global IPv6 address (prefix from router + interface identifier, e.g., *2001:db8:0:1:ccd2:82ff:fe52:728b/64* |

Both for *link-local* and *global auto-configuration*, it is possible
to auto-configure using a random suffix instead of the interface
identifier.


### Examples

![Switch example (eth0 and lo)](img/ip-address-example-switch.svg)

    admin@example:/> show interfaces
    INTERFACE       PROTOCOL   STATE       DATA
    eth0            ethernet   UP          02:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv6                   fe80::ff:fe00:0/64 (link-layer)
    lo              ethernet   UP          00:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv4                   127.0.0.1/8 (static)
                    ipv6                   ::1/128 (static)
    admin@example:/>

To illustrate IP address configuration, the examples below uses a
switch with a single Ethernet interface (eth0) and a loopback
interface (lo). As shown above, these examples assume *eth0* has an
IPv6 link-local address and *lo* has static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses by
default.

#### Static and link-local IPv4 addresses

                    ipv6                   ::1/128 (static)
    admin@example:/>

As shown, the link-local IPv4 address is configured with `set autconf
enabled true`.  The resulting address (169.254.1.3/16) is of type
*random* ([ietf-ip.yang][2]).

#### Use of DHCP for IPv4 address assignment

![Using DHCP for IPv4 address assignment](img/ip-address-example-ipv4-dhcp.svg)

    admin@example:/config/> edit dhcp-client
    admin@example:/config/dhcp-client/> set client-if eth0

    admin@example:/config/dhcp-client/> leave
    admin@example:/> show interfaces
    INTERFACE       PROTOCOL   STATE       DATA
    eth0            ethernet   UP          02:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv4                   10.1.2.100/24 (dhcp)
                    ipv6                   fe80::ff:fe00:0/64 (link-layer)
    lo              ethernet   UP          00:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv4                   127.0.0.1/8 (static)
                    ipv6                   ::1/128 (static)
    admin@example:/>

The resulting address (10.1.2.100/24) is of type *dhcp*.


#### Disabling IPv6 link-local address(es)

The (only) way to disable IPv6 link-local addresses is by disabling IPv6
on the interface.

```(disabling
admin@example:/> configure
admin@example:/config/> edit interface eth0 ipv6
admin@example:/config/interface/eth0/ipv6/> set enabled false
admin@example:/config/interface/eth0/ipv6/> leave
admin@example:/> show interfaces
INTERFACE       PROTOCOL   STATE       DATA
eth0            ethernet   UP          02:00:00:00:00:00
lo              ethernet   UP          00:00:00:00:00:00
                ipv4                   127.0.0.1/8 (static)
                ipv6                   ::1/128 (static)
admin@example:/>
```

#### Static IPv6 address

    admin@example:/>

#### Stateless Auto-configuration of Global IPv6 Address

![Auto-configuration of global IPv6](img/ip-address-example-ipv6-auto-global.svg)

Stateless address auto-configuration of global addresses is enabled by
default. The address is formed by concatenating the network prefix
advertised by the router (here 2001:db8:0:1::0/64) and the interface
identifier.  The resulting address is of type *link-layer*, as it is
formed based on the interface identifier ([ietf-ip.yang][2]).

    admin@example:/> show interfaces
    INTERFACE       PROTOCOL   STATE       DATA
    eth0            ethernet   UP          02:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv6                   2001:db8:0:1:0:ff:fe00:0/64 (link-layer)
                    ipv6                   fe80::ff:fe00:0/64 (link-layer)
    lo              ethernet   UP          00:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv4                   127.0.0.1/8 (static)
                    ipv6                   ::1/128 (static)
    admin@example:/>

Disabling auto-configuration of global IPv6 addresses can be done as shown
below.

    admin@example:/> configure
    admin@example:/config/> edit interface eth0 ipv6
    admin@example:/config/interface/eth0/ipv6/> set autoconf create-global-addresses false
    admin@example:/config/interface/eth0/ipv6/> leave
    admin@example:/> show interfaces
    INTERFACE       PROTOCOL   STATE       DATA
    eth0            ethernet   UP          02:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv6                   fe80::ff:fe00:0/64 (link-layer)
    lo              ethernet   UP          00:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv4                   127.0.0.1/8 (static)
                    ipv6                   ::1/128 (static)
    admin@example:/>

#### Random Link Identifiers for IPv6 Stateless Autoconfiguration

![Auto-configuration of global IPv6](img/ip-address-example-ipv6-auto-global.svg)

By default, the auto-configured link-local and global IPv6 addresses
are formed from a link-identifier based on the MAC address.

    admin@example:/> show interfaces
    INTERFACE       PROTOCOL   STATE       DATA
    eth0            ethernet   UP          02:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv6                   2001:db8:0:1:0:ff:fe00:0/64 (link-layer)
                    ipv6                   fe80::ff:fe00:0/64 (link-layer)
    lo              ethernet   UP          00:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv4                   127.0.0.1/8 (static)
                    ipv6                   ::1/128 (static)
    admin@example:/>

To avoid revealing identity information in the IPv6 address, it is
possible to specify use of a random identifier ([ietf-ip.yang][2] and
[RFC8981][3]).

    admin@example:/> configure
    admin@example:/config/> edit interface eth0 ipv6
    admin@example:/config/interface/eth0/ipv6/> set autoconf create-temporary-addresses true
    admin@example:/config/interface/eth0/ipv6/> leave
    admin@example:/> show interfaces
    INTERFACE       PROTOCOL   STATE       DATA
    eth0            ethernet   UP          02:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv6                   2001:db8:0:1:b705:8374:638e:74a8/64 (random)
                    ipv6                   fe80::ad3d:b274:885a:9ffb/64 (random)
    lo              ethernet   UP          00:00:00:00:00:00
                    ipv4                   127.0.0.1/8 (static)
                    ipv6                   ::1/128 (static)
    admin@example:/>

Both the link-local address (fe80::) and the global address (2001:)
have changed type to *random*.

### IPv4 forwarding
To be able to route (static or dynamic) on the interface it is
required to enable forwarding. This setting controlls if packets
received on this interface can be forwarded.
   ```
   admin@example:/config/> edit interface eth0
   admin@example:/config/interface/eth0/> set ipv4 forwarding
   admin@example:/config/interface/eth0/> leave
   admin@example:/>
   ```

### IPv6 forwarding
This flag behaves totally different than for IPv4. For IPv6 the
ability to route between interfaces is always enabled, instead this
flag controls if the interface will be in host/router mode.

| **Feature**                               | **Forward enabled** | **Forward disabled** |
|:------------------------------------------|:--------------------|:---------------------|
| IsRouter set in Neighbour Advertisements. | Yes                 | No                   |
| Transmit Router Solicitations.            | No                  | Yes                  |
| Router Advertisements are ignored         | No                  | Yes                  |
| Accept Redirects                          | No                  | Yes                  |

   ```
   admin@example:/config/> edit interface eth0
   admin@example:/config/interface/eth0/> set ipv6 forwarding
   admin@example:/config/interface/eth0/> leave
   admin@example:/>
   ```

### IPv4 Static routes
Remember to enable [IPv4 forwarding](#IPv4-forwarding) for the interfaces.

    admin@example:/> configure
    admin@example:/config/> edit routing control-plane-protocol static name default
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/static/name/default/> set ipv4 route 192.168.200.0/24 next-hop next-hop-address 192.168.1.1
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/static/name/default/> leave
    admin@example:/>

> **Note:** You can only have one instance per routing protocol.

### IPv6 Static routes

    admin@example:/> configure
    admin@example:/config/> edit routing control-plane-protocol static name default
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/static/name/default/> set ipv6 route 2001:db8:3c4d:200::/64 next-hop next-hop-address 2001:db8:3c4d:1::1
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/static/name/default/> leave
    admin@example:/>

> **Note:** You can only have one instance per routing protocol.

### OSPFv2 Routing
Infix supports OSPF dynamic routing for IPv4, i.e., OSPFv2.
Remember to enable [IPv4 forwarding](#IPv4-forwarding) for the
interfaces you want to run OSPFv2.

    admin@example:/config/> edit routing control-plane-protocol ospfv2 name default
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/> set ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface e0 enabled true
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/> leave
    admin@example:/>

> **Note:** You can only have one instance per routing protocol.

#### OSPF area types
In addition to *regular* OSPF areas, area types *NSSA* and *Stub* are supported.

To configure a NSSA area with summary routes:

    admin@example:/config/> edit routing control-plane-protocol ospfv2 name default
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/> set ospf area 0.0.0.1 area-type nssa-area
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/> set ospf area 0.0.0.1 summary true
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/> leave
    admin@example:/>

#### Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
It is possible to enable BFD per interface to speed up detection of
link loss.

    admin@example:/config/> edit routing control-plane-protocol ospfv2 name default
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/ospf/> set area 0.0.0.0 interface e0 bfd enabled true
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/> leave
    admin@example:/>

#### OSPF interface settings

We have already seen how to enable OSPF per interface (*enabled true*)
and BFD for OSPF per interface (*bfd enabled true*). These and other
OSPF interface settings are done in context of an OSFP area, e.g.,
*area 0.0.0.0*. Available commands can be listed using the `?` mark.

    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/> edit ospf area 0.0.0.0
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/ospf/area/0.0.0.0/> edit interface e0
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/ospf/area/0.0.0.0/interface/e0/> set ?
      bfd                  BFD interface configuration.
      cost                 Interface's cost.
      dead-interval        Interval after which a neighbor is declared down
      enabled              Enables/disables the OSPF protocol on the interface.
      hello-interval       Interval between Hello packets (seconds).  It must
      interface-type       Interface type.
      passive              Enables/disables a passive interface.  A passive
      retransmit-interval  Interval between retransmitting unacknowledged Link
      transmit-delay       Estimated time needed to transmit Link State Update
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/ospf/area/0.0.0.0/interface/e0/> set

For example, setting the OSPF *interface type* to *point-to-point* for
an Ethernet interface can be done as follows.

    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/ospf/area/0.0.0.0/interface/e0/> set interface-type point-to-point
    admin@example:/config/routing/control-plane-protocol/ospfv2/name/default/ospf/area/0.0.0.0/interface/e0/>


#### Debug OSPFv2

Using NETCONF and the YANG model *ietf-routing* it is possible to read
the OSPF routing table, neighbors and more, that may be useful for
debugging the OSPFv2 setup. The CLI has various OSPF status commands
such as `show ospf neighbor`, `show ospf interface` and `show ospf
routes`.

    admin@example:/> show ospf neighbor

### View routing table

The routing table can be viewed from the operational datastore over
NETCONF or using the CLI:

#### IPv4 routing table

    admin@example:/> show routes ipv4
    PREFIX                        NEXT-HOP                      PREF  PROTOCOL
    192.168.1.0/24                e0                                  kernel
    192.168.200.0/24              192.168.1.1                     20  static
    admin@example:/>

#### IPv6 routing table

    admin@example:/> show routes ipv6
    PREFIX                        NEXT-HOP                      PREF  PROTOCOL

    fe80::/64                     eth5                           256  kernel
    fe80::/64                     eth3                           256  kernel

#### Source protocol

The source protocol describes the origin of the route.

| **Protocol** | **Description**                                                      |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| kernel       | Added when setting a subnet address on an interface                  |
| static       | User created static routes                                           |
| dhcp         | Routes retrieved from DHCP                                           |
| ospf         | Routes retreived from OSPFv2                                         |

The YANG model *ietf-routing* support multiple ribs but only two are
currently supported, namely `ipv4` and `ipv6`.

[2]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8344
[3]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8981

[^1]: Please note, link aggregates are not yet supported in Infix.
[^2]: Link-local IPv6 addresses are implicitly enabled when enabling
    IPv6.  IPv6 can be enabled/disabled per interface in the
    [ietf-ip][2] YANG model.
[^3]: For example, IPv4 groups are mapped to MAC multicast addresses by
    mapping the low-order 23-bits of the IP address in the low-order 23
    bits of the Ethernet address 01:00:5E:00:00:00.  Meaning, more than
	one IP multicast group maps to the same MAC multicast group.
