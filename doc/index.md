![Infix - Linux <3 NETCONF](logo.png){ width=480 align=right }

Welcome to Infix, your immutable, friendly, and secure operating system!
On these pages you can find both user and developer documentation.

Most topics on configuring the system include CLI examples, but every
setting, as well as status read-back from the operational datastore, is
also possible to perform using NETCONF or RESTCONF.  In fact, the Infix
regression test system solely relies on NETCONF and RESTCONF.

> [!TIP]
> The CLI documentation is also available from inside the CLI itself
> using the `help` command in admin-exec mode.
