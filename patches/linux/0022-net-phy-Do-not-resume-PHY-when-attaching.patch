Subject: [PATCH 22/33] net: phy: Do not resume PHY when attaching
Organization: Addiva Elektronik

The PHY should not start negotiating with its link-partner until
explicitly instructed to do so.

Therefore, skip resuming the PHY in the attach phase, deferring it to
when phy_start() is called from the net_device's open() callback,
possibly via phylink_start().

Otherwise, drivers that attached to their PHYs during
probing (e.g. DSA) would end up with a physical link being
established, even though the corresponding interface was still
administratively down.
