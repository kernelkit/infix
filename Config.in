config INFIX_OEM_PATH
	string "Path to OEM br2-external"

	  A br2-external using Infix will likely want to version the branded
	  OS using their own GIT tags.  Set this variable to point to the base
	  directory (absolute path) and the Infix post-build.sh will call `git
	  describe -C $INFIX_OEM_PATH`.

	  Note: for release builds the global variable INFIX_RELEASE overrides
	  the version information derived from `git describe`.  However, the
	  GIT version is always saved as the BUILD_ID in /etc/os-releases.
