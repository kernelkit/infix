This section detail a few recommendations for maintaining co-existence in this scenario of the multiple producers problem.</p> <p>First, there's a clear difference between \"singleton\" like hostsname and an interface IP address.  Consider the case of a static IP and a DHCP assigned IP, these can co-exist because of the <code>proto NUM</code> field available in iproute2.  This is used in Infix so that static addresses can be flushed independently of DHCP addresses.  The same can be done by other \"address providers\", e.g., PROFINET.</p> <p>Changing properties like hostname should be done by injecting a change into Infix, by for example calling <code>sysrepocfg -Ediff.xml</code>.  Here is an example of how to get the current hostname and apply an XML diff:</p> <pre><code>root@infix-00-00-00:~# sysrepocfg -X -x \"/system/hostname\" &gt; hostnm.xml\nroot@infix-00-00-00:~# cat hostnm.xml\n&lt;system xmlns=\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system\"&gt;\n  &lt;hostname&gt;infix-00-00-00&lt;/hostname&gt;\n&lt;/system&gt;\nroot@infix-00-00-00:~# edit hostnm.xml\nroot@infix-00-00-00:~# sysrepocfg -Ehostnm.xml\nroot@example:~#\n</code></pre> <p>Second, perform all changes on <code>running-config</code>, the running datastore. That way you have a clear state to return to if your application needs to do a factory reset.  E.g., in PROFINET a type 1/2 factory reset will reset only the PROFINET specific settings.  That way you can actually have your system <code>startup-config</code> disable all physical ports and the PROFINET application enables only ports that are not deactivated.  (On factory reset it will not know of any ports to deactivate so it will activate all.)</p> <p>You can consider the system composed of two entities:</p> <ul> <li>NETCONF starts up the system using <code>startup-config</code>, then</li> <li>Hands over control to your application at runtime</li> </ul> <p>Infix is prepared for this by already having two \"runlevels\" for these two states.  The <code>startup-config</code> is applied in runlevel S (bootstrap) and the system then enters runlevel 2 for normal operation.</p> <p>This allow you to keep a set of functionality that is provided by the underlying system, and another managed by your application.  You can of course in your br2-external provide a sysrepo plugin that block operations on certain datastores when your application is enabled. E.g., to prevent changes to startup after initial deployment.  In that case a proper factory reset would be needed to get back to a \"pre-deployment\" state where you can reconfigure your baseline.</p>"},{"location":"branding/#releases","title":"Releases","text":"<p>A release build requires the global variable <code>INFIX_RELEASE</code> to be set.

Infix does not come with a built-in registry, so the <code>docker://</code> option is best used with external services, which in turn require networking to be up.  In a deployment phase the easiest may be to set up a single interface on your host system with DHCP client.</p> <p>The default method is <code>docker://</code>, so when setting the <code>image</code> for your container, you can omit the <code>docker://</code> prefix.  You can also use the admin-exec command <code>container pull docker://...</code>, and when configuring a container <code>podman</code> will check first if it has the image before trying to download anything.  (See also the upgrade section, below.)</p> <p>The <code>oci-archive:/</code> is interesting since many users may not have, or do not want to, publish their images in a registry.  Use the Docker OCI exporter or any other tool that supports generating OCI Image format.

All network access has to be set up explicitly. Currently two types of of container networks are supported:</p> <ul> <li><code>host</code>: an managed host interface, e.g., one end of a VETH pair,    or even a physical interface</li> <li><code>bridge</code>: an IP masquerading bridge</li> </ul> <p>In the former the interface is delegated to (moved into) the container, while in the latter a VETH pair is automatically created by Podman and one end delegated to the container, while the other end is assigned to the bridge (see the next section).</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>For more information on VETH pairs, see the Networking Guide.</p>"},{"location":"container/#container-bridge","title":"Container Bridge","text":"<p>A container bridge is what most container setups use and users want.</p> <p></p> <p>The difference from a regular bridge is that the container runtime fully manages them -- connecting containers with automatically created VETH pairs (look at the bridge port names) and setting up firewall rules between the host and other containers, as well as managing port forwarding.  This transparent background management is what makes container use seem to be so simple.</p> <p>All interface configuration is done in configure context.</p> <pre><code>admin@example:/&gt; configure\nadmin@example:/config&gt; edit interface docker0\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/&gt; set container-network\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/&gt; leave\n</code></pre> <p>There is more to this story.  When using the CLI, and sticking to common interface nomenclature, Infix helps you with some of the boring stuff. E.g., creating a new interface with a name like <code>brN</code> or <code>dockerN</code> automatically infers the interface types, which you would otherwise have to set manually:</p> <pre><code>admin@example:/config/interface/docker0/&gt; set type bridge\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/&gt; set container-network type bridge\n</code></pre> <p>Important</p> <p>When configuring the system via an API such as NETCONF or RESTCONF, no settings are inferred.  Instead it is up to the caller to fully define the desired setup.  This makes the CLI very useful for first setup and then extracting the resulting XML from the shell using the <code>cfg -X</code> command.</p> <p>We have to declare the interface as a container network, ensuring the interface cannot be used by the system for any other purpose.  E.g., a container <code>host</code> interface is supposed to be used by a container, by declaring it as such we can guarantee that it would never accidentally be added as a bridge or lag port.  Hence, to move an interface currently set as a <code>bridge-port</code> it must be removed from the bridge before being given to a container.</p> <p>The default subnet for a container <code>bridge</code> is 172.17.0.0/16, the bridge takes the <code>.1</code> address and hand out the rest of the range to containers in a round-robin like fashion.  A container with this <code>network</code> get an automatically created VETH pair connection to the bridge and a lot of other networking parameters (DNS, default route) are set up.</p> <p>Some of the defaults of a container <code>bridge</code> can be changed, e.g., instead of <code>set container-network type bridge</code>, above, do:</p> <pre><code>admin@example:/config/interface/docker0/&gt; edit container-network\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/container-network/&gt; set type bridge\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/container-network/&gt; edit subnet 192.168.0.0/16\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/container-network/subnet/192.168.0.0/16/&gt; set gateway 192.168.255.254\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/container-network/subnet/192.168.0.0/16/&gt; end\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/container-network/&gt; edit route 10.0.10.0/24\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/container-network/route/10.0.10.0/24/&gt; set gateway 192.168.10.254\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/container-network/route/10.0.10.0/24/&gt; end\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/container-network/&gt; end\nadmin@example:/config/interface/docker0/&gt; leave\n</code></pre> <p>Other network settings, like DNS and domain, use built-in defaults, but can be overridden from each container.  Other common settings per container is the IP address and name of the network interface inside the container.  The default, after each stop/start cycle, or reboot of the host, is to name the interfaces <code>eth0</code>, <code>eth1</code>, in the order they are given in the <code>network</code> list, and to give the container the next address in a <code>bridge</code>.  Below an example of a system container calls <code>set network interface docker0</code>, here we show how to set options for that network:</p> <pre><code>admin@example:/config/container/ntpd/&gt; edit network interface docker0\nadmin@example:/config/container/ntpd/network/interface/docker0/&gt;\nadmin@example:/config/container/ntpd/network/interface/docker0/&gt; set option\n&lt;string&gt;  Options for masquerading container bridges.\nadmin@example:/config/container/ntpd/network/interface/docker0/&gt; help option\nNAME\n        option &lt;string&gt;\n\nDESCRIPTION\n        Options for masquerading container bridges.\n\n        Example: ip=1.2.3.4            -- request a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6)\n                 mac=00:01:02:c0:ff:ee -- set fixed MAC address in container\n                 interface_name=foo0   -- set interface name inside container\n\nadmin@example:/config/container/ntpd/network/interface/docker0/&gt; set option ip=172.17.0.2\nadmin@example:/config/container/ntpd/network/interface/docker0/&gt; set option interface_name=wan\nadmin@example:/config/container/ntpd/network/interface/docker0/&gt; leave\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"container/#container-host-interface","title":"Container Host Interface","text":"<p>Another common use-case is to move network interfaces into the network namespace of a container<sup>2</sup>.

For    more information, see Membership Report</li> <li>Membership Report A membership report is sent by end-devices and    forwarded by switches to the elected querier on the LAN.  They    consist of multiple \"join\" and \"leave\" operations on groups.  They    can also, per group, list which senders to allow or block.  Switches    usually only support the group subscription, and even more common    also only support filtering on the MAC level<sup>5</sup></li> <li>Querier election: the process of determining who is the elected    IGMP/MLD querier on a LAN.  Lowest numerical IP address wins, the    special address 0.0.0.0 (proxy querier) never wins</li> <li>Proxy querier: when no better querier exists on a LAN, one or    more devices can send proxy queries with source address 0.0.0.0 (or    :: for IPv6).  See Query Interval, below, why this is a good    thing</li> <li>Query interval: the time in seconds between two queries from an    IGMP/MLD querier.  It is not uncommon that end-devices do not send    their membership reports unless they first hear a query</li> <li>Fast Leave: set on a bridge port to ensure multicast is pruned as    quickly as possible when a \"leave\" membership report is received.  In    effect, this option marks the port as directly connected to an    end-device.  When not set (default), a query with timeout is first    sent to ensure no unintentional loss of multicast is incurred</li> <li>Router port: can be both configured statically and detected at    runtime based on connected devices, usually multicast routers.  On    a router port all multicast is forwarded, both known and unknown</li> <li>Flood port: set on a bridge port (default: enabled) to ensure    all unknown multicast is forwarded</li> <li>Router timeout: the time in seconds until a querier is deemed to    have been lost and another device (switch/router) takes over.  In the    tables shown above, a None timeout is declared when the current    device is the active querier</li> </ul> <p>Tip</p> <p>The reason why multicast flooding is enabled by default is to ensure safe co-existence with MAC multicast, which is common in industrial networks.  It also allows end devices that do not know of IGMP/MLD to communicate over multicast as long as the group they have chosen is not used by other IGMP/MLD aware devices on the LAN.</p> <p>As soon as an IGMP/MLD membership report to \"join\" a group is received the group is added to the kernel MDB and forwarding to other ports stop.  The only exception to this rule is multicast router ports.</p> <p>If your MAC multicast forwarding is not working properly, it may be because an IP multicast group maps to the same MAC address.  Please see RFC 1112 for details.  Use static multicast router ports, or static multicast MAC filters, to mitigate.</p>"},{"location":"networking/#forwarding-of-ieee-reserved-group-addresses","title":"Forwarding of IEEE Reserved Group Addresses","text":"<p>Addresses in the range <code>01:80:C2:00:00:0X</code> are used by various bridge signaling protocols, and are not forwarded by default.

This very short guide intends to help you with that.</p> <p>New users usually get the CLI as the default \"shell\" when logging in, but the default <code>admin</code> user logs in to <code>bash</code>.  To access the CLI, type:</p> <pre><code>admin@host-12-34-56:~$ cli\n\nSee the 'help' command for an introduction to the system\n\nadmin@host-12-34-56:/&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The prompt (beginning of the line) changes slightly.

See <code>help keybindings</code> for more tips!</p>"},{"location":"cli/introduction/#key-concepts","title":"Key Concepts","text":"<p>The two modes in the CLI are the admin-exec and the configure context.</p> <p>The top-level context after logging in and starting the CLI is the admin-exec or \"main\" context.  It is used for querying system status, managing configuration files/profiles and doing advanced debugging.</p> <p>Available commands can be seen by pressing <code>?</code> at the prompt:</p> <pre><code>admin@host:/&gt;\n  configure      Create new candidate-config based on running-config\n  copy           Copy file or configuration, e.g., copy running-config startup-config\n  dir            List available configuration files\n  exit           Exit from CLI (log out)\n  factory-reset  Restore the system to factory default state\n  follow         Monitor a log file, use Ctrl-C to abort\n  help           Help system (try also the '?' key)\n  logout         Alias to exit\n  netcalc        IP subnet calculator, with subnetting\n  password       Password tools\n  ping           Ping a network host or multicast group\n  poweroff       Poweroff system (system policy may yield reboot)\n  reboot         Reboot system\n  remove         Remove a configuration file\n  set            Set operations, e.g., current date/time\n  show           Show system status and configuration files\n  tcpdump        Capture network traffic\n  upgrade        Install a software update bundle from remote or local file\n</code></pre> <p>The system has three main datastores (or files): factory, startup, and running that can be managed and inspected using the <code>copy</code>, <code>show</code>, and <code>configure</code> commands.  The traditional names used in the CLI for these are listed below:</p> <ul> <li><code>factory-config</code> the default configuration from factory for the    device, i.e., what the system returns to after a <code>factory-reset</code></li> <li><code>startup-config</code> created from <code>factory-config</code> at first boot after    factory reset.  Loaded as the system configuration on each boot</li> <li><code>running-config</code> what is actively running on the system.  If no    changes have been made since boot, it is the same as <code>startup-config</code></li> <li><code>candidate-config</code> is created from <code>running-config</code> when entering the    configure context.  Any changes made here can be discarded (<code>abort</code>,    <code>rollback</code>) or committed (<code>commit</code>, <code>leave</code>) to <code>running-config</code></li> </ul> <p>Edit the running configuration using the <code>configure</code> command.  This copies running to candidate, a temporary datastore, where changes are made:</p> <pre><code>admin@host-12-34-56:/&gt; configure\nadmin@host-12-34-56:/config/&gt; ...             # Try: Tab or ?\nadmin@host-12-34-56:/config/&gt; leave\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>leave</code> command activates the changes by issuing a transaction to, essentially, copy the candidate back to running.  Depending on the changes made, this can take a few seconds.  If the changes are invalid, i.e., not correct according to the underlying YANG models, a warning is shown and the session remains in configure context.  Use the <code>abort</code> command to cancel your changes, or investigate further with the <code>diff</code> command (see more below).</p> <p>To save configuration changes made to the <code>running-config</code> to persistent store, so the system will use them for consecutive reboots, use the <code>copy</code> command:</p> <pre><code>admin@host-12-34-56:/&gt; copy running-config startup-config\n</code></pre> <p>In configure context the following commands are available:</p> Command Description <code>set foo bar val</code> Set <code>bar</code> leaf node in <code>foo</code> subcontext to <code>val</code> <code>no foo bar</code> Clear/delete configuration made to <code>bar</code> in <code>foo</code> <code>edit foo baz</code> Enter <code>baz</code> sub-sub-context in <code>foo</code> subcontext <code>change password</code> Start password dialogue to change a user's password <code>text-editor foo</code> Open a text editor to edit binary setting <code>foo</code> <code>abort</code> Abort changes in configuration, return to admin-exec <code>exit</code> Exit one level sub-context, or abort from top-level <code>leave</code> Save changes to <code>running-config</code>, return to admin-exec <code>show [foo]</code> Show configured values (optionally in subcontext) <code>diff [foo]</code> Show uncommitted changes in candidate <code>do command</code> Call admin-exec command: <code>do show log</code> <code>commit</code>"},{"location":"cli/introduction/#example-session","title":"Example Session","text":"<p>Remember to use the <code>TAB</code> and <code>?</code> keys to speed up your navigation.

This depends of course on how the switch is set up, for instance if routing between all ports is enabled, each flow will reach the CPU, but in a plain switching setup it will not.</p> <pre><code>                      .---------.\n                      |         |\n                      |   CPU   |\n                      |         |\n                      '----+----'\n                           |\n                           |\n                .----------+---------.\n                |                    |\n             ---+                    +---\n            E1  |         SC         |  E3\n             ---+                    +---\n            E2  |                    |  E4\n                '--+--+--+--+--+--+--'\n                   |  |  |  |  |  |\n                  E5 E6 E7 E8 E9 E10\n</code></pre> <p>So, running <code>tcpdump e1</code> in a switching setup, inside the CPU, the only traffic that will be captured is traffic ingressing port E1 destined for the CPU itself.  To analyze traffic going through the switch, you need something called port mirroring, or port monitoring, i.e., setting up the switch core to mirror traffic ingressing and/or egressing a set of ports to another port.  On this monitor port you can then run your tcpdump, which means you need an external device (laptop).</p> <p>A planned feature is to support mirroring traffic to the CPU port, which would be an effective way to log and monitor traffic over a longer period of time.  Highly effective for diagnosing intermittent and other rare network issues.</p> <p>If only \"proof of life\" is required, then sometimes port counters, also called RMON counters, can be very useful too.  Seeing counters of a particular type increment means traffic is ingressing or egressing.</p>"},{"location":"cli/tcpdump/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<p>Listen to all traffic on an interface:</p> <pre><code>admin@example:/&gt; tcpdump e1\n</code></pre> <p>Listen to only ping traffic:</p> <pre><code>admin@example:/&gt; tcpdump e1 expression icmp\n</code></pre> <p>Listen to traffic on a given port:</p> <pre><code>admin@example:/&gt; tcpdump e1 expression \"port 80\"\n</code></pre> <p>Wait for one ping only:</p> <pre><code>admin@example:/&gt; tcpdump e1 count 1 expression icmp\n</code></pre> <p>Very verbose output:</p> <pre><code>admin@example:/&gt; tcpdump e1 verbose\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cli/text-editor/","title":"Text Editor","text":""},{"location":"cli/text-editor/#text-editor","title":"Text Editor","text":"<p>The CLI built-in <code>text-editor</code> command can be used to edit type <code>binary</code> settings in configure context.</p> <p>The default editor is a Micro Emacs clone.
