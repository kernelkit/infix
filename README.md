Introduction
------------

Infix is an embedded Linux Network Operating System (NOS) based on
[Buildroot][1], [Finit][2], [ifupdown-ng][3], and [sysrepo][6].
Providing an easy-to-maintain and easy-to-port Open Source base for
networked equipment.

Infix has two main *flavors*, or defconfigs:

 - **NETCONF:** the default, managed using, e.g., the `cli` tool
 - **Classic:** built from `$ARCH_classic_defconfig`, more below

Both flavors have an `admin` user, which is allowed to log in from
remote, password `admin` on standard builds.  It is the recommended
account to use for managing Infix.  (The `root` account is currently
also available, but will soon become a non-login account used only for
running system services.)


### NETCONF Mode

NETCONF is the primary reason Infix exists.  Configuration of an Infix
device can be done either remotely, using tools like [netconf-client][]
or [netopeer2-cli][], or locally using the [`cli` tool](doc/cli.md).

Infix use [sysrepo][6] as the data store for NETCONF.  A set of plugins
configure the network, using iproute2, generate configuration files in
`/etc`, and control the system daemons, e.g., enable DHCP client on an
interface.


### Classic Mode

Here it is up to the administrator to modify configuration files in
`/etc` and control the system daemons using the `initctl` tool.

See the online `help` command for an introduction to the system.


### Hybrid Mode

Since Infix is under heavy development, it does not yet have all bells
and whistles in place, in particular in the default build.  To that end
it is possible to manually manage certain services that are not yet
possible to configure using NETCONF.

At bootstrap Finit can start user scripts from a [run-parts(8)][] like
directory: `/cfg/start.d`.  For example, the following starts OSPF:

```sh
root@infix:~$ mkdir /cfg/start.d
root@infix:~$ cd /cfg/start.d
root@infix:~$ cp -a /etc/frr .
root@infix:/cfg/start.d$ cat <<EOF >10-enable-ospf.sh
#!/bin/sh
# Use vtysh to modify the OSPF configuration
mount --bind /cfg/frr /etc/frr
initctl enable zebra
initctl enable ospfd
initctl enable bfdd
exit 0
EOF
root@infix:/cfg/start.d$ chmod +x 10-enable-ospf.sh
```

This is also the way to start containers (provided the images have been
downloaded with `podman pull` first):

```
root@infix:/cfg/start.d$ cat <<EOF >20-enable-container.sh
#!/bin/sh
podman-service -e -d "Nginx container" -p "-p 80:80 -v /cfg/www:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro" nginx:alpine
exit 0
EOF
root@infix:/cfg/start.d$ chmod +x 20-enable-container.sh
```

Reboot to activate the changes.  To activate the changes without
rebooting, run the script and call `initctl reload`.

> **Note:** Neither [Frr](https://frrouting.org) (Zebra/OSPF/BFD) or
> [podman](https://podman.io) are enabled in default Infix builds.  Some
> customers have them enabled in their specific builds, and you can also
> enable it yourself in Infix by using `make menuconfig` followed by
> rebuilding the image.

For more information, see [Containers in Infix](doc/container.md).


Hardware
--------

### aarch64

By default, Infix builds with support for the following boards (you
may enable additional boards in the config, of course):

- Marvell CN9130 CRB
- Marvell EspressoBIN
- Microchip SparX-5i PCB135 (eMMC)

See the aarch64 specific [documentation](board/aarch64/README.md) for more
information.

### x86_64

Primarily intended to be run under [QEMU][] for development & test as
well as evaluation, demo and [training][] purposes, e.g. using [GNS3][]
or [Qeneth][7].


QEMU
----

A virtualized instance can easily be launched from a Linux system, with
Qemu installed, by issuing `make run`.

Some settings, e.g. networking, can be configured via `make menuconfig`
under `External options -> QEMU virtualization`.


GNS3
----

Download the [latest build][0] of the `x86_64`, or `x86_64_classic`
flavor.  Unpack in a dedicated directory and use ["Import Appliance"][9]
to install the `.gns3a` file into GNS3.  Infix (`x86_64`) is in the
"Router" category, it has 10 interfaces available by default for use as
switch ports or routing.  The *classic* build only has one interface by
default, geared more towards acting as an end device.


Building
--------

Buildroot is almost stand-alone, but need a few locally installed tools
to bootstrap itself.  For details, see the [excellent manual][manual].

Briefly, to build an Infix image; select the target and then make:

    make x86_64_defconfig
    make

Online help is available:

    make help

To see available defconfigs for supported targets, use:

    make list-defconfigs

> **Note:** build dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu): <kbd>sudo apt install make libssl-dev</kbd>


Origin & Licensing
------------------

Infix is entirely built on Open Source components (packages).  Most of
them, as well as the build system with its helper scripts and tools, is
from [Buildroot][1], which is distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License (GPL).  See the file COPYING for details.

Some files in Buildroot contain a different license statement.  Those
files are licensed under the license contained in the file itself.

Buildroot and Infix also bundle patch files, which are applied to the
sources of the various packages.  Those patches are not covered by the
license of Buildroot or Infix.  Instead, they are covered by the license
of the software to which the patches are applied.  When said software is
available under multiple licenses, the patches are only provided under
the publicly accessible licenses.

Infix releases include the license information covering all Open Source
packages.  This is extracted automatically at build time using the tool
`make legal-info`.  Any proprietary software built on top of Infix, or
Buildroot, would need separate auditing to ensure it does not link with
any GPL[^1] licensed library.

[^1]: Infix image builds use GNU libc (GLIBC) which is covered by the
	[LGPL][4].  The LGPL *does allow* proprietary software, as long as
	said software is linking dynamically, [not statically][5], to GLIBC.
