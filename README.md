<img align="right" src="doc/logo.png" alt="Infix - Linux <3 NETCONF" width=480 border=10>

Turn any ARM or x86 device into a powerful, manageable network appliance
in minutes. From $35 Raspberry Pi boards to enterprise switches ‚Äî deploy
routers, IoT gateways, edge devices, or custom network solutions that
just work.

## Our Values

**üîí Immutable**  
Your system never breaks.  Read-only filesystem with atomic upgrades
means no configuration drift, no corrupted updates, and instant rollback
if something goes wrong.  Deploy once, trust forever.

**ü§ù Friendly**  
Actually easy to use. Auto-generated CLI from standard YANG models comes
with built-in help for every command ‚Äî just hit `?` or TAB for
context-aware assistance.  Familiar NETCONF/RESTCONF APIs and
[comprehensive documentation][4] mean you're never stuck.  Whether
you're learning networking or managing enterprise infrastructure.

**üõ°Ô∏è Secure**  
Built with security as a foundation, not an afterthought.  Minimal
attack surface, separation between system and data, and container
isolation.  Sleep better knowing your infrastructure is protected.

## Why Choose Infix

**Hardware Flexibility**: Start with a $35 Raspberry Pi, scale to
enterprise switching hardware.  Same OS, same tools, same reliability.

**Standards-Based**: Built around YANG models and IETF standards. Learn
once, use everywhere - no vendor lock-in.

**Container Ready**: Run your applications alongside networking
functions.  GPIO access, dedicated Ethernet ports, custom protocols ‚Äî
your device, your rules.

## Use Cases

1. **Home Labs & Hobbyists**:  
   Transform a Raspberry Pi into a full-featured router with WiFi  
1. **IoT & Edge Computing**:  
   Bridge devices to the cloud with reliable, updatable gateways  
1. **Small Business Networks**:  
   Enterprise-grade features without the complexity or cost  
1. **Developers & Makers**:  
   Test networking concepts, prototype IoT solutions, or build custom
   appliances
1. **Network Professionals**:  
   Consistent tooling from development to production deployment.  
   How about a digital twin using raw Qemu or [GNS3](https://gns3.com/infix)!

```

Notice how TAB completion shows available options, `show` displays
current config, and `diff` shows exactly what changed before you
commit your changes with the `leave` command.

## Get Started

Get [pre-built images][5] for your hardware.  Use the CLI, web
interface, or standard NETCONF/RESTCONF tools, e.g., `curl`.  Add
containers for any custom functionality you need.

### Supported Platforms

- **Raspberry Pi 4B** - Perfect for home labs, learning, and prototyping
- **NanoPi R2S** - Compact dual-port router in a tiny package  
- **x86_64** - Run in VMs or on mini PCs for development and testing
- **Marvell CN9130 CRB, EspressoBIN** - High-performance ARM platforms
- **Microchip SparX-5i, NXP i.MX8MP EVK** - Enterprise switching capabilities
