	  Simple factory reset program/login-shell for instructing the
	  system to factory reset itself, and reboot.

	  The program is made to run as SUID root to be able to tell the
	  system to reboot.  Sufficient care has been taken to make the
	  factory program as secure as possible.  With the worst possible
	  eftect to only be abused to reboot the system.
