Subject: [PATCH 35/44] make sure that edit tree is the first sibling
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Organization: Wires

After a bug in velia [1], where we passed to Session::editBatch a tree
which was not the first sibling (and this caused that all the left
siblings of the node were not considered in the edit), I am making sure
that we do not lose any data in this project due to this too.
