	  InitViz is a performance analysis and visualization tool for the
	  boot process and system services.  It consists of the bootchartd
	  data collection daemon (bootchartd) that runs during boot to
	  capture system activity, and InitViz the host visualization tool.

	  InitViz is a reimplementation and successor to the bootchart2
	  project, offering a more feature-rich solution compared to the
	  bootchartd subset available as a BusyBox applet.

	  To profile the boot process, append the following to the kernel
	  command line:

	      init=/sbin/bootchartd initcall_debug printk.time=y quiet

	  The collected data can be visualized using the host-initviz
	  tool, initviz.py, which is currently not built here.
