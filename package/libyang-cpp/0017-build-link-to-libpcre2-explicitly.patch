Subject: [PATCH 17/18] build: link to libpcre2 explicitly
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Organization: Wires

This is apparently a problem on Mac OS X builds where the transitive
dependency via libyang doesn't take effect:

 Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
   "_pcre2_code_free_8", referenced from:
       libyang::Regex::~Regex() in Regex.cpp.o
       libyang::Regex::~Regex() in Regex.cpp.o
 ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64

Let's fix this by linking with libpcre2-8 directly.

We're using a different approach than libyang; they have their own CMake
wrapper. I find it easier to work with pkg-config modules, so let's try
it that way.
