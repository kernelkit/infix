Subject: [PATCH 3/8] remove a misleading comment

The whole intention within action's input/output handling here was to
put some emphasis on the fact that we aren't tracking the input/output
nodes directly. However, looking at all the other classes this is a bit
redundant, we're using a pattern like this all the time. Just drop the
comment.
