=== Basic NACM permissions

ifdef::topdoc[:imagesdir: {topdoc}../../test/case/system/nacm-basic]

==== Description

Test that NACM groups (admin, operator, guest) correctly enforce
access control with path-based rules and default policies.

Creates three user privilege levels from scratch:

- admin: Full access (permit-all rule)
- operator: Can manage interfaces/routing, cannot modify system config
- guest: Read-only access (write-default: deny, exec deny rule)

Verifies that:

- All users can read configuration (read-default: permit)
- Operators can modify interfaces (path-specific permit rule)
- Operators cannot modify system configuration (write-default: deny)
- Guests cannot modify any configuration (write-default: deny)
- Admin can modify all configuration (permit-all rule bypasses defaults)
