== Interfaces

Tests verifying interface configuration and management:

 - VLAN interface configuration and connectivity
 - IPv4 and IPv6 address assignment and management
 - IPv4 address auto-configuration mechanisms  
 - Interface aliases and physical address configuration
 - IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding between interfaces
 - Linux bridge creation, STP, and VLAN handling
 - Link aggregation (LAG) setup and failover behavior
 - IGMP multicast group management and forwarding
 - QoS traffic classification and priority handling
 - Interface enable/disable state management
 - Virtual Ethernet (VETH) pair lifecycle management
 - GRE tunneling configuration and data plane operation
 - Tunnel TTL (Time-To-Live) and hop-limit verification
