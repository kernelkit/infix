==== Sequence

. Set up topology and attach to target DUT
. Set target:data static MAC address '02:01:00:c0:ff:ee'
. Verify target:data has MAC address '02:01:00:c0:ff:ee'
. Reset target:data MAC address to default
. Verify target:data MAC address is reset to default
. Set target:data to chassis MAC
. Verify target:data has chassis MAC
. Set target:data to chassis MAC + offset
. Verify target:data has chassis MAC + offset
. Reset target:data MAC address to default
. Verify target:data MAC address is reset to default
