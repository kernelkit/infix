=== DHCP Server

ifdef::topdoc[:imagesdir: {topdoc}../../test/case/infix_dhcp/server_basic]

==== Description

Verify basic DHCP server functionality.  The server is set up to only
hand out leases from a pool of a single address.  A single DHCP option,
hostname, is to be handed out with the lease to the client.  Ensure no
other options are sent by checking, e.g., that the client has not set up
a default route to the server.
