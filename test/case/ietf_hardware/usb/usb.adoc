=== USB configuration
==== Description
This test checks if the configuration is consistent with hardware state,
and verifies whether the USB ports are correctly _locked_ (restricted from
use) and _unlocked_ (available for use) when they should. It also verifies
this behavior during reboot. This test does not involve the actual use of
the USB port; it only ensures the configured state is consistent with the
hardware state.

If this pass you can be certain that the configuration of the USB
port is handled correctly.
