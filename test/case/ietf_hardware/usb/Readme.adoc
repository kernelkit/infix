=== USB configuration
==== Description
This will test if the configuration is consistent with hardware state,
if the USB ports are _locked_ (forbidden for use) and _unlocked_
(Ready for use) when they should. Also test if it is the case during
reboot. This does not the test actual use of the USB port, just check
that the configured state is consistent with the hardware state.

If this pass you can be certeain of that the configuration of the USB
port is handled correctly.
