=== mDNS reflector

ifdef::topdoc[:imagesdir: {topdoc}../../test/case/services/mdns/mdns_reflector]

==== Description

Verify the mDNS reflector functionality.  The reflector forwards mDNS
requests and responses between different network interfaces, allowing
service discovery across network segments.

We verify operation with two scenarios:

 1. Reflector enabled: mDNS traffic from host:data1 SHOULD be reflected
    to host:data2 and host:data3
 2. Reflector disabled: mDNS traffic from host:data1 should NOT be
    reflected to host:data2 and host:data3

==== Topology

==== Sequence

. Set up topology and attach to target DUT
. Configure device interfaces and enable mDNS
. Verify mDNS from host:data1 is reflected to host:data2 and host:data3
. Verify mDNS from host:data1 is not reflected after disabling reflector
