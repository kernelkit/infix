=== Ling Aggregation Basic

ifdef::topdoc[:imagesdir: {topdoc}../../test/case/ietf_interfaces/lag_basic]

==== Description

Verify communication over a link aggregate in static and LACP operating
modes during basic failure scenarios.

.Internal network setup, PC verifies connectivity with dut2 via dut1

The host verifies connectivity with dut2 via dut1 over the aggregate for
each test step using the `mon` interface.

==== Topology

==== Sequence

. Set up topology and attach to target DUTs
. Set up LACP link aggregate, lag0, on dut1 and dut2
. Verify failure modes for lacp mode
. Set up static link aggregate, lag0, on dut1 and dut2
. Verify failure modes for static mode
