==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target DUT
. Enable target interface
. Set fixed 10/full
. Set fixed 10/half
. Set fixed 100/full
. Set fixed 100/half
. Switch to auto-negotiation mode for target and host
. Configure host to advertise 10/Full only
. Configure host to advertise 10/Half only
. Configure host to advertise 100/Full only
. Configure host to advertise 100/Half only
. Configure host to advertise 10/half + 10/full + 100/half
. Configure host to advertise 10/half + 10/full + 100/half + 100/full + 1000/full
