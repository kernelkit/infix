=== Interface Speed Duplex (Copper)
==== Description
Verify that the interface operates at the expected speed/duplex in two scenarios:

1. Fixed configuration – host and target are both manually set to a specific speed/duplex
2. Auto-negotiation – host advertises selectable modes and the target negotiates
 to the highest common speed/duplex.

==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target DUT
. Enable target interface
. Verify fixed 10/full
. Verify fixed 10/half
. Verify fixed 100/full
. Verify fixed 100/half
. Switch to auto-negotiation mode for target and host
. Verify auto-negotiation to 10/Full only
. Verify auto-negotiation to 10/Half only
. Verify auto-negotiation to 100/Full only
. Verify auto-negotiation to 100/Half only
. Verify auto-negotiation to 10/half + 10/full + 100/half
. Verify auto-negotiation to 10/half + 10/full + 100/half + 100/full + 1000/full
