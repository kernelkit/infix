==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target DUT
. Set up VLAN interface on host:data with IP 10.0.0.1
. Configure VLAN 10 interface on target:data with IP 10.0.0.2
. Wait for links to come up
. Verify that host:data can reach 10.0.0.2
. Remove VLAN interface from target:data
. Verify that host:data can no longer reach 10.0.0.2
