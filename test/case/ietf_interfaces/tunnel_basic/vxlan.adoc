ifdef::topdoc[:imagesdir: {topdoc}../../test/case/ietf_interfaces/tunnel_basic]

==== Description

Set up a tunnel between two DUTs, host connected to the first DUT.  Enable
IP forwarding on first DUT's interface to host and the tunnel interface to
the second DUT.  On host, add route to IP network of second DUT and verify
connectivity with the second DUT through the tunnel.

- Tunnel types: GRE, GRETAP, and VxLAN
- Connectivity: IPv4 and IPv6

==== Topology

==== Sequence

. Set up topology and attach to target DUTs
. Configure DUTs with tunnel vxlan
. Verify connectivity host:data to 10.0.0.2
. Verify connectivity host:data to 2001:db8::c0a8:0a02
