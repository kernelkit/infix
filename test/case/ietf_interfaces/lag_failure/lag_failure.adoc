=== LACP Aggregate w/ Degraded Link
==== Description
Verify communication over an LACP link aggregate when individual member
links stop forwarding traffic, without carrier loss.

.Logical network setup, link breakers (lb1 & lb2) here managed by host PC

The host verifies connectivity with dut2 via dut1 over the aggregate for
each failure mode step using the `mon` interface.

==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target DUTs
. Set up link aggregate, lag0, between dut1 and dut2
. Initial connectivity check ...
. Verify failure modes
