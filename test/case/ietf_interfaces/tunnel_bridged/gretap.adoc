=== GRETAP bridged with physical interface

ifdef::topdoc[:imagesdir: {topdoc}../../test/case/ietf_interfaces/tunnel_bridged]

==== Description

Set up a layer-2 tunnel between two DUTs, host is connected to the first DUT.
Bridge the interface connected to the host and the tunnel interface on the
first DUT.  On host, verify connectivity with the second DUT through tunnel.

- Tunnel types: GRETAP, and VxLAN
- Connectivity: IPv4
