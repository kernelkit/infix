=== VLAN Interface Termination
==== Description
Verify that VLANs stacked on top of an interfaces that are also
attached to a VLAN filtering bridge are always locally terminated.

In this setup, even though VLAN 10 is allowed to ingress and egress on
both `data0` and `data1`, _bridging_ of packets from one to the other
must _not_ be allowed.

==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target
. Configure bridge and VLAN interfaces on target
. Configure IP addresses and VLAN interfaces on host
. Verify that host:data0 reaches host:data1 with untagged packets
. Verify that traffic on VLAN 10 from host:data0 does not reach host:data1
. Verify that host:data0 can reach target on VLAN 10
. Verify that host:data1 can reach target on VLAN 10
