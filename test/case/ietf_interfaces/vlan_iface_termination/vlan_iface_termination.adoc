=== VLAN Interface Termination
==== Description
Verify that VLANs stacked on top of an interfaces that are also
attached to a VLAN filtering bridge are always locally terminated.

In this setup, even though VLAN 10 is allowed to ingress and egress on
both `data1` and `data2`, _bridging_ of packets from one to the other
must _not_ be allowed.

==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target
. Configure bridge and VLAN interfaces on target
. Configure IP addresses and VLAN interfaces on host
. Verify that host:data1 reaches host:data2 with untagged packets
. Verify that traffic on VLAN 10 from host:data1 does not reach host:data2
. Verify that host:data1 can reach target on VLAN 10
. Verify that host:data2 can reach target on VLAN 10
