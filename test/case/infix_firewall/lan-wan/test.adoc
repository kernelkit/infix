==== Sequence

. Set up topology and attach to gateway
. Configure gateway with firewall and SNAT
. Verify LAN access to router
. Verify LAN services accessibility
. Verify WAN access to router is blocked
. Verify WAN blocks all well-known ports
. Verify LAN-to-WAN connectivity (outbound)
. Verify LAN-to-WAN masquerading
. Verify WAN-to-LAN blocking (inbound)
