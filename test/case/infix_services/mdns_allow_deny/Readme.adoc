=== mDNS allow/deny interfaces
==== Description
Verify the mDNS responder interface allow/deny configuration.  Both
settings can be used independently and in concert.  We verify operation
with three scenarios:

 1. Allow p2, no mDNS traffic should be received on p1 and p3
 2. Deny p2, mDNS traffic should only be received on p1 and p3
 3. Allow p1 and p3, deny p2 and p3, traffic only on p1

==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target DUT
. Configure device
. Allow mDNS on a single interface: p2
. Deny mDNS on a single interface: p2
. Allow mDNS on p1, p3 deny on p2, p3
