=== Container with bridge network
==== Description
Verify connectivity with a simple web server container from behind a
docker0 bridge.  As an added twist, this test also verifies content
mounts, i.e., custom index.html from running-config.

This also verifies port forwarding from container internal port to a
port accessed from the host.
