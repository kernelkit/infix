=== Container environment variables
==== Description
Verify that environment variables can be set in container configuration
and are available inside the running container. Tests the 'env' list
functionality by:

1. Creating a container with multiple environment variables
2. Using a custom script to extract env vars and serve them via HTTP
3. Fetching the served content to verify environment variables are set correctly

Uses the nftables container image with custom rc.local script.
