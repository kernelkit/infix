== Routing

Tests verifying standard routing protocols and configuration:

 - Static routing configuration and forwarding behavior
 - OSPF basic neighbor discovery and LSA exchange
 - OSPF unnumbered interface configuration
 - OSPF multi-area configuration and inter-area routing
 - OSPF with BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection)
 - OSPF default route advertisement and propagation
 - OSPF debug logging configuration and verification
 - RIP basic neighbor discovery and route exchange
 - RIP passive interface configuration
 - RIP route redistribution (connected, static, and OSPF)
 - RIP multi-hop routing with multiple neighbors
 - Route preference handling for OSPF routes
 - Route preference handling for DHCP-learned routes
 - Administrative distance configuration (route preference 255)
