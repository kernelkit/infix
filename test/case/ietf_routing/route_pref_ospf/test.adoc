=== Route preference: OSPF vs Static

ifdef::topdoc[:imagesdir: {topdoc}../../test/case/ietf_routing/route_pref_ospf]

==== Description

This test configures a device with both an OSPF-acquired route on a
dedicated interface and a static route to the same destination on
another interface. The static route has a higher preference value than
OSPF.

Initially, the device should prefer the OSPF route; if the OSPF route 
becomes unavailable, the static route should take over.

==== Sequence

. Set up topology and attach to target DUTs
. Set up TPMR between R1ospf and R2ospf
. Configure targets
. Set up persistent MacVlan namespaces
. Wait for OSPF and static routes
. Verify connectivity from PC:data1 to PC:data2 via OSPF
. Simulate OSPF route loss by blocking OSPF interface
. Verify connectivity via static route after OSPF failover
