==== Test sequence
. Configure targets
. Wait for routes
. Configure host addresses and routes
. Verify that R2 is reachable on 192.168.200.1 from PC:data
. Verify that R2 is reachable on 2001:db8:3c4d:200::1 from PC:data
. Remove all static routes from R1
. Verify R2 is no longer reachable on either IPv4 or IPv6 from PC:data
