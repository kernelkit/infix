=== OSPF with multiple areas
==== Description
This test test alot of features inside OSPF using 3 areas (one NSSA area)
to test the distribution of routes is deterministic (using cost), also test
link breaks using BFD (not implemented in infamy though)

==== Test sequence
. Configure targets
. Wait for all neighbor to peer
. Wait for routes from OSPF on all routers
. Verify Area 0.0.0.1 on R3 is NSSA area
. Verify on R3, there are no routes beyond 10.0.23.1, just a default route
. Testing connectivitiy through NSSA area, from PC:data3 to 11.0.8.1
. Verify that the route to 10.0.0.3 from PC:data4, go through 10.0.41.2
. Break link R1:ring2 --- R4:ring1
. Verify that the route to 10.0.0.3 from PC:data4, go through 10.0.24.1
