==== Description
This test test alot of features inside OSPF using 3 areas (one NSSA area)

link breaks using BFD (not implemented in infamy though)

==== Test sequence
. Initialize
. Configure targets
. Wait for neighbors
. Wait for routes from OSPF
. Verify NSSA area
. Testing connectivitiy through NSSA area
. Verify correct hops
. Disable link between R1 and R4, and verify correct hops
