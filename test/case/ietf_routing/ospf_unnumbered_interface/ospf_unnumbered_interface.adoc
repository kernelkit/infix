=== OSPF unnumbered interfaces
==== Description
This test that a configuration expecting unnumbered interfaces
get that also in OSPF. Also verify that passive interface in
the configuration gets activated in OSPF.

When this test pass, you can expect unnumbered interfaces, interface type
configuration and passive to function

==== Test sequence
. Set up topology and attach to target DUTs
. Configure targets
. Wait for OSPF routes
. Verify interface type on R1:link and R2:link is point-to-point
. Verify there are no OSPF HELLO packets on PC:data
. Test connectivity from PC:data to 192.168.200.1
